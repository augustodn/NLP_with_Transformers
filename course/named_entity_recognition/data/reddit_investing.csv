First of all they have 1k buy limits per 24hr hours, you have to call and tell them to allow over 1k for that 24hr hour period. Not a huge deal but it is an inconvenience. Where it gets bad is when they close at 2:30 and you can’t make a purchase over 1k till the next day (which with stocks, crypto, etc. you all know a lot can change very quickly) this has happened a few times causing me to already get frustrated. 

The big one that pushed me over, I wanted to buy 4k of a crypto coin (I know some is for it and others against it, that’s not why I’m here) the coin dipped and I was ready to buy, I called the bank and told them I was gonna make a 4k charge on the debit card so they could okay it. When I tried to make the purchase it failed… I called back and asked why. The lady checked and said oh we can’t allow that because the company you’re trying to buy from is out of the US. I said oh no it’s okay, they are a well trusted company, could you please allow the transaction to go through? Nope she said, we are not able to allow that transaction to go through, as we are not allowed to. She said the best we can do is an ACH transfer. Well 6 days pass and I get the 4k in the account that I wanted it to be in, but by the time the 6 days passed the coin went back up. I knew it would and was planning on selling when it did, which ended up costing me a little under 3.5k profit I coulda made. Nothing crazy but still… bank screwed me out of 3.5k.

All data is FY 2021 and taken from their filings as well as their investor relations website. Guidance is taken from their press release 2/27/2022.

Cashflow from operations was $23.6BN, of that $2.7BN came from Rosneft so 2021 was $20.9BN excluding Rosneft.

Average realizations for the year were $63.60 (Liquids), $5.11 (Nat Gas) and $33.75 (Total Hydocarbon's BOE).

Guidance given:

Dividends to increase 4% for 2022, so going from $4.6BN to $4.78BN.

Capex expected to be $14BN to $15BN, lets use $15BN.

Divesting (excluding anything from Rosneft) $2BN to $3BN, lets use $2BN.

Surplus cash (after dividends and capex) to be shared 60% on buybacks and 40% on debt reduction.

Expect to be able to do $4BN in buybacks even at $60 per barrel.

\*\*\*my math\*\*\* if $4BN for backbacks at 60% surplus cash then would mean $2.7BN for debt reduction at 40%.

Total cashflow required for all of the above is $26.48BN, less the divesting gives $24.48BN.

So BP needs to expand is Cashflow from operations from $20.9NB (2021 excl Rosneft) to $24.48BN, which is a 17% increase. As I expect average realizations to be at least 30% up in 2022 and possibly way higher I am concluding that BP's 2022 target is more than achievable.

If above plays out then free cash flow yield would be &gt;10% at current share price.

In addition, anything they can get from their divesture of Rosneft will be a cash benefit, whereas the market may (incorrectly in my opinion) get hung up on next earnings as Rosneft can no longer be considered equity so there is an $11BN hit for historical foreign exchange losses and different of Rosneft fair value as of March 31st and carrying value of $14BN.

EU sanctions will hurt some sectors, but the bloc didn’t sanction gas and oil, which would hit both Russia and Europe’s economies hardest

If the conflict is prolonged, sanctions escalate in both directions, and energy supply is reduced, the eurozone economy could enter a recession that would last from early summer through the start of 2023, according to economists at Moody’s Analytics.

“If Russia goes further and restrains supply, or there is damage to pipelines, we could see a significant spike in prices,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. “All that would work towards a stagflation scenario.”

Economists at insurance giant Allianz SE take a similar view of what they call a “blackout” scenario in which Russia cuts energy supplies. In addition to pushing the eurozone economy into recession, they estimate the eurozone’s average annual rate of inflation in 2022 would rise to 6.3% from the 3.8% they expected to see before the invasion."|investing|For Europe, Russia Sanctions Will Sting|8.0|0.6

This book helped me to have a basic knowledge of bonds and the hierarchy of the rating by credit agencies as well as how bonds are affected by interest rates and how they have performed historically, as well as the risks and dangers of different bond types such as government, municipals, and corporate bonds, as well as junk bonds.

However, I want to get into a much deeper understanding of how to invest in bonds. Are there any good bond screeners? I also find it difficult trying to find the CUSIP of specific bonds. I feel that finding ticker symbols has been much easier. Do you guys use any tools that help you find different individual bond CUSIPS? 

I would also like to be able to have a better knowledge of how to value specific bonds such as corporates. I have been reading *Security Analysis,* which covers this to some extent, but I feel that the language is a bit outdated and a lot of times I am finding myself trying to find out the terminology he employs. Are there any good books, videos, or resources on individual bond analysis? 

Lastly, how about distressed investing such as investing in bonds of bankrupt companies? Reading Klarman and Greenblatt's chapters on investing in bankruptcy and fallen angels and so, I also want to get familiarized with this field. Yes, I know the dangers of this, but I still at the very least want to know how people analyze investing in distressed companies.

China has relaxed restrictions on imports of Russian wheat, a move that could address food security concerns in the world's second largest economy and ease the impact of Western sanctions on Russia.

The decision to allow imports of wheat from all regions of Russia was made during Russian President Vladimir Putin's visit to Beijing earlier this month, but the details were only announced by China's customs administration this week.

Russia is the world's top producer of wheat. Previously, China had restricted wheat imports from Russia due to concerns about the presence of dwarf bunt fungus — a disease that can cause severe loss of yield for wheat and other crops — in some parts of the country.

I've noticed that in my industry (public/nonprofit sector), the companies who manage 403(b) retirement accounts all have forced investment choices that are garbage. 


The only options available for contribution at any job I've had are a small group of incredibly high fee annuities. The lowest fee options I've ever seen are 0.35%, which is frankly absurd. I'm in my early 30s, so my approach until now has been to choose the lowest fee account of 100% equities and only contribute the bare minimum salary for maximum corporate match.


None of the annuities in my 403(b) have ever outperformed my own personal mix of ETFs, indexes, and stocks in my Roth IRA and personal investment account. These are my ""real"" retirement accounts that I contribute the most to. I don't particularly have a complex portfolio, either: Most of my money is in VOO, VTI, QQQ, and various individual blue chip stocks.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/t0odtg/the\_second\_biggest\_opportunities\_in\_buying\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/t0odtg/the_second_biggest_opportunities_in_buying_the/)

The first biggest opportunity was obliviously the starting period of pandemic. I believe a lot of savvy investors had seized that opportunity. Here, I believe, we are facing what could be the second biggest opportunity. 

There are two big dark clouds hovering over the market, one of which is the high inflation and the other is this war panic regarding Ukraine. 

I’d like to shed some light on both. Firstly, our currently high inflation, in my opinion, this is a classical macroeconomic event heavy involving misjudgment caused by Central banks worldwide (lead by US Fed) which has been repetitiously occurring for a number of times. 

Our currently high inflation situation resembles, in many ways, the Great Inflation happened in 1960-1980 which was originated from an excessive growth in the supply of money from US Fed accompanied by the by-then US President Johnson’s Great Society Initiative. During that time, under the impact of energy crisis the US Fed still continued to assist the administration to achieve what called maximum employment initiative with issuing huge amount of debts and deliberately keeping low interest rates, which eventually lead to the 1960-1980 great inflation.                 

A close study of that great inflation period would find us many similarities between that time and ours. What our time has experienced is almost the same thing except for the pandemic with trillions of dollars printed by central banks and the energy crisis caused by the sudden shift to renewable energy called by all the governments worldwide.

A foreseeable consequence based on the experience in the 1960 Great Inflation would be a much higher interest rates compared with prior years, the important question is just by how much will the interest rates go. 

Clearly, in both instances (ours and the 1960 Great Inflation) we could see the misjudgment of the US Feds. Reminder you that our current Fed chair only recently (in 2020) withdrawn his original idea about inflation was transitory and brought forward around 2 years in terms of hiking interest rate (only a year ago they expected the hiking would be in 2024 including Australian RBA). 

With the expectations of higher interest rate, logically we are having a lower stock market. However, as a long-term investor who only invest in best quality stocks, I’m not that concerned, more importantly we are not in 1980s because of many different changes nowadays. 

But Let me show you the following stock trend after 1960 Great Inflation when the by-then US Fed Paul Volcker conquered the great inflation by hiking the interest rates to as high as 19%. Interestingly, when interest rates reached all time high at almost 19%, the stock market had actually bottomed. But it took a number of years until S&amp;P500 recached the bottom, after which the market started 2 decades bull trend. Therefore, our biggest question would be how long would it take until our stock price reached the bottom (meaning when is the time to buy the dip), is our market going to be failing for around a decade until it reached its bottom like the Great Inflation period? I think the answer is no. 

A thorough thinking on 1960 Great Inflation and the 1982’ beginning of bull market would give use some clues on how inflation has correlated with the interest rate and stock market. Based on various charts in this post, one would find the stock market eventually bottomed when the interest rate peaked with correspondingly lower inflation (also unemployment peaked at 11%) in 1982.  

A deeper look at that time and background gives me the answer that our situation largely depends on how long it takes for the Fed to realize their misjudgment and revise their policies.

It took the former Fed and administration a decade to realize their misjudgment in 1960-1980 and remediated their policies. In contrast, it took 2 years for current US Fed revised their original thinking and now they are already for hiking. This is a good signal for us. 

Additionally, employment goes very well and we have lots of new technologies to tackle energy crisis such as EVs and solar power when comparing with the 1960s-1980s. As a result, I’m actually more optimistic than many peers about our current situation due to the above factors. As a matter of fact, this situation is the one I’ve been waiting and prepared for a year as I’ve been selling many high PE but low-quality stocks to accumulate cash for this big dip. But I’m still holding my many-year low PE high cash flow holdings like Apple, Berkshire due to the reason that they are the best ones and most likely they would never drop to my purchase price when I made after the start of this pandemic.

Second dark cloud we are facing is the war panic or concern, it’s a sensitive topic but actually, it’s what I want to discuss is very short. Yes, and there will be energy concern regarding this, and also there is potential risk of an expanding war. But as many great investors including Warren Buffett who experienced WW2 and many others has already told us don’t afraid of buying in war time."|investing|The second biggest opportunities in buying the dip in recent years.|3.0|0.57

&gt;Earnings per share (EPS): $3.32, versus $1.85 expected, according to a Refinitiv survey of analysts
&gt;Revenue: $2.5 billion, versus $1.94 billion expected, according to Refinitiv

&gt;The company predicted that retail Monthly Transaction Users (MTUs) and total trading volume would be lower in Q1 2022 compared to Q4 2021. Coinbase attributed the change to decreased crypto asset volatility and a 20% decrease in crypto market capitalization quarter-to-date. It said the declining market cap is driven by macroeconomic factors like geopolitical instability and the U.S. Federal Reserve signaling a tightening of financial conditions.

&gt;Coinbase expects subscriptions and services revenue to be lower in Q1 because of crypto asset price declines.

&gt;In the fourth quarter, MTUs grew to 11.4 million in Q1, up from 7.4 million in Q3. That came after Coinbase saw a decline in MTUs between Q2 and Q3.

&gt;It also saw net income double quarter-over-quarter to $840 million in Q4. That’s several times the net income Coinbase saw in Q4 2020, when it reported $177 million.

&gt;The report comes after major cryptocurrencies saw a weak month in December despite an overall explosion in value in 2021. Investors blamed the slow end to the year on concerns about cryptocurrency’s energy consumption and on macroeconomic factors like the rise of the omicron Covid variant.

&gt;Coinbase warned shareholders in the previous quarter that its stock should be considered a long-term investment since its business is “volatile.”

&gt;That’s been demonstrated in recent weeks as major cryptocurrencies like bitcoin fell amid concerns that Russian troops would invade Ukraine. That’s led some analysts to question the idea that bitcoin could act as a safe-haven currency in times of geopolitical instability.

&gt;Coinbase warned in its letter to shareholders that 2022 will continue to have a fair amount of uncertainty for its business.

&gt;“We enter 2022 with even more unknowns which make our business all the more difficult to forecast,” the company wrote, pointing to “global macroeconomic headwinds” on top of unpredictable crypto asset prices, rising interest rates and inflation. But, it said, it sees increased opportunities and adoption of cryptocurrency.

Personal take: $COIN is a bit of an oddball in terms of growth stock. On one hand it suffers all the volatility associated with the cryptocurrency market, but on the other hand it's got a P/E ratio that is *half* of $AAPL. It is also investing in ancillary revenue channels beyond trading fees, which is good for diversification but is still fundamentally tied to the staying power and public interest of the crypto space.

Meanwhile, the Case-Shiller national home price index demonstrated 18.8% growth between 2020 and 2021 in December, in line with November’s reading.

“This is the highest calendar year increase in 34 years of data, and
substantially ahead of 2020’s 10.4% gain,” Craig J. Lazzara, managing director at S&amp;P DJI, said in the Case-Shiller report.


What happened: Phoenix recorded the highest rate of home-price growth in the country in December, according to the Case-Shiller report, with a 32.5% year-over-year increase. As with the month prior, two Florida cities closely followed: Tampa with a 29.4% gain and Miami with a 27.3% rise.

The FHFA report showed that home-price growth during the fourth quarter of 2021 was strongest in Arizona, Utah and Idaho, and weakest in the District of Columbia, Louisiana and North Dakota. That report recorded the highest pace of home-price appreciation in Cape Coral-Ft. Myers, Fla., where prices rose 34.6% on an annual basis.

Looking ahead: “Home prices continued to surpass expectations in December, but a marked change may be ahead for growth as rising mortgage rates eat into homebuyer purchasing power,” said Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com.

“While typical asking prices continue to accelerate, the pace of median sales price growth has slowed, signaling a potential gap between what buyers are willing and able to pay and what sellers are hoping to net,” she added.

**UPDATE:**

The responses to this have been across the spectrum and some of them really strong reactions.

**First:**

I proposed truly small, symbolic sums to send a message. Why?

*---* Because of this:

***' In Russia, Margarite Simonyan, the head of the state-owned Russian RTnews network, gloated last week that “Kyiv’s economy is in tatters,”calling it “a small but pleasant thing.” '***

*-*\-- And this:

*' One by one, embassies and international offices in Kyiv closed. Flight after flight was canceled when insurance companies balked at covering planes arriving in Ukraine.* ***Hundreds of millions of dollars in investment dried up within weeks.'***

*' “Why is it that we are suffering consequences already? And Russia, who is actually threatening the whole world, in Europe, is not suffering any consequences?” asked Andrey Stavnitser, CEO of the port operator TIS Group.'*

*' The* ***squeezing of Ukraine’s economy is a key destabilizing tactic in what the government describes as “hybrid warfare”*** *intended to eat away at the country from within. '*

*'Alex Riabchyn is a former member of Ukraine’s parliament who now spearheads a project to set up hydrogen plants for the national Naftogaz energy company. The idea is to give Europe — and especially its largest economy, Germany — a stable new source of hydrogen, which can be used to produce low-emission energy for transport, industry and other uses.*

*' What he hears from European investors now is “we can buy everything that you can produce, but to come and invest to build these plants, it’s too risky.” '*

*'German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock over the weekend acknowledged that the constant threat against Ukraine is* ***“having very real effects — on investments, on air traffic, on jobs and on the daily life of people.” '***

So I simply wanted to send a message back. I was talking $20, $50, seriously

I definitely support sending far more money to NGOs that will help people on the ground.

Messages and gestures are important too. They speak and answer on a world stage. Putin laid a 5000 word essay on the world not too long ago, I am wrong to talk back with $20 I know I will lose?  I don't think so. I support charities that help people on the ground, but what is being done to their economy is angering them terribly, and rightly so.

**Second:**

I couldn't find an ETF with meaningful exposure to Ukraine, nor any Ukrainian stocks trading in the US. That doesn't mean you can't use a global account to access them and bonds as well, but I am basically a Joe Schmoe investor who never opened a global trading account. I said I would look into it and report back, and that is where that's at for me so far I am afraid. Others I know are more savvy than I on international markets.  But I am going to contact my broker to find out if there is a quick way to do one transaction. Hey, RT sat there laughing about this when all Ukraine ever did to them is vote for independence so, yeah, I wanted to invest because they were laughing that no one was

**What is CarLotz? ($LOTZ)**  
*(from Yahoo Finance) CarLotz is a used vehicle consignment and Retail Remarketing™ business that provides our corporate vehicle sourcing partners and retail sellers of used vehicles with the ability to access the previously unavailable retail sales channel, while simultaneously providing buyers with prices that are, on average, below those of traditional dealerships. Our mission is to create the world's greatest vehicle buying and selling experience. We operate a technology-enabled buying, sourcing, and selling model that offers a seamless omnichannel experience and comprehensive selection of vehicles, while allowing for a fully contactless end-to-end e-commerce interface that enables no-hassle buying and selling.*

*Our proprietary Retail Remarketing™ technology provides our corporate vehicle sourcing partners with real-time performance metrics and data analytics, along with custom business intelligence reporting that enables price and vehicle triage optimization between the wholesale and retail channels. Through our marketplace model, we generate significant value for both sellers and buyers through price, selection, and experience.*

**TL;DR:** They provide distribution hubs where corporate fleets and other sellers can consign their used vehicles, cutting out traditional dealer network/wholesale channel middlemen and therefore being able to both pay more to the sellers and offer cheaper prices to buyers, while keeping their own overhead super low because they don't buy the cars to hold as inventory.

So let's talk about it.

**Revenue Growth Monster**

CarLotz has absolutely obliterated its earnings over and over again. And I mean just  curbstomped them for the last 4 quarters in a row. But don't take my word for it. [Check it for yourself.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/carlotz-announces-third-quarter-2021-210100062.html)

Highlights from the linked report:  
\- Record third quarter revenue of $68 million, representing 128% year over year revenue growth  
\- 58% increase in retail unit sales, despite substantial inventory/supply issues from chip shortage  
\- 190% increase in finance and insurance revenue  
\- more than doubled their number of distribution hubs

Consensus analyst estimate for 1y price is $7.50. From today's price, that represents 324% upside.

Outside simple revenue growth, [they're best in class in a number of metrics.](https://gyazo.com/c067c88dfe594cb281b3cff192855569)

But we can't let new upstart industry disruptors just steal market share and innovate without consequences right?

**Here come the shorts again.**

This is a brand new business model, and this means they're a huge threat to the established used car dealers. And guess what? ***They're shorted to absolute shit as a result.*** Established dealers (especially primary competitor Carvana ($CVNA)) want CarLotz to die in the cradle, and the best way to do that is to drive its share price into the ground so that one of the big dogs can scoop it up at a severe discount. [And that's exactly what we're seeing.](https://gyazo.com/6262369ec957e017f02353f730f8756f)

Go figure. All the short interest is happening in dark pools off-exchange. 66% short volume is massive. And it suggests that the shorts aren't from retail investors, but it's all the usual market manipulators.

$LOTZ's share price has tanked HARD for the last year, from a 52-week high of $10.85 down to only $1.78 as of today. The only headwind against them has been the chip shortage, which they admitted was causing some inventory and supply issues. But that's been affecting every car dealer. 

For more quick proof that $LOTZ is way oversold, compare quarterly revenues vs. market cap with $CVNA. Third quarter revenue for Carvana was $3.9 billion. Proportionally to their $21b market cap, that's roughly 19% (for the crayon eaters, that means it takes roughly 5 quarters to generate revenue equal to the company's market cap).

$LOTZ's $68 million quarterly revenue compared to their $200m market cap is 34%, ***meaning they generate revenue equal to their company's current market cap every 3 quarters.*** That is *nuts*, especially for a brand-new start-up. If $LOTZ's share price were to match the ratio $CVNA has, their market cap would be $340 million, a 70% upside from current prices. And that's great, but that's also ignoring the simple truth that new companies often trade at a higher multiple because of future growth prospects further juicing prices. So it makes even *less sense* that share price is performing so poorly.

Until you add back in the market manipulation.

**If you buy CarLotz now, and it eventually hits Carvana's current market cap ($21 billion) which is totally plausible, you'll have a 100-bagger. 10,000% growth.**

See you on the other side of a 1000%+ return. It's only a matter of when, not if.

**TL;DR - Buy CarLotz.**

I have some stock I bought last year that are doing pretty poorly right now; let's use Palintir (PLTR) as an example.

I bought PLTR at $28. It's currently around $10.

**If I sell PLTR**:

- Benefit: I tax loss harvest. I haven't technically lost money on my investment because I can roll over losses indefinitely 

- The only cost is opportunity cost of future gains (either in PLTR or other stock)

**If I buy $10 PTLR shares now and sell $28 PLTR shares 31 days later**: 	

- If PLTR is over $28, I make money.

- If PLTR is under $28, I TLH while reducing my PLTR cost basis to $10

I believe that the stock market is, short term, based on about 40% Fundamentals and 60% on Technical Analysis and other time-the-market predictions. I believe that the stock market is, long term, MOSTLY based on Fundamentals. However, I think that in both the short and long-term, stock prices should NOT reflect Fundamentals this much. 

The main concept that I am basing my opinion on is the idea that you will get money back on your investment, and that amount of money is equal to how much equity you have in a company. This is a sham idea, or at least not as good as people make it out to be. Another equally sham idea is the concept of ""future earnings"". You think you will get your future earnings in the future. When? In the future. How far in the future? Whenever the company pays dividends, but you will get ONLY A PORTION of those ""future earnings"". But what if the company doesn't pay dividends, when will I get my future earnings then? Whenever the company is liquidated. When will that happen? Potentially never because lots of companies live a long time. Think of General Electric, which went public like 120 or so years ago. If you bought shares in GE at the IPO and GE never paid dividends, you would be dead before you'd get your precious ""future earnings"". I know that GE broke up once or something so I'm just estimating the amount of years it's been public. Either way, it's a damn long time and they'll be around for likely another 120 years too. 

The only reason anyone should give a shit about how a company is performing is if the following ""events"" occur. These events I will now list are the Fundamentals that I believe are CORRECTLY changing the prices of stocks. They are not related to future earnings (except for dividends, which really aren't the same as the aforementioned 240 year long wait for earnings), but instead are specific events that have an immediate effect on the stock price, events that affect the price due to anticipation of such events, or both. I have likely missed some (or many) things, as these are events that I am giving rigorously specific definitions. If I forgot to mention some other event, or if there are missing pieces related to any listed event, I would prefer if you would not criticize me on this, unless you actually have something else to say that's relevant to the main idea of this post.

All of the events I will mention thus are based on fundamentals and not technical analysis.

All of these events may cause the price to rise or fall due to anticipation of the event as well, but I will not mention this phenomenon for most of these events' descriptions(but I will for some) because it is implied that anticipation has an effect. Therefore, most of these will be about the affect on the price, positive or negative, AFTER the event occurs.

(positive) Share buybacks

\--&gt; This has a mathematical effect on the price: it lowers the amount of shares outstanding, which logically raises the price of current outstanding shares.

(negative) New share issuances

\--&gt; This has a mathematical effect on the price, the opposite of share buybacks

(negative) Good employee performance

\--&gt; What I mean by this being negative is that when certain employees(usually management) perform well, they are many times rewarded with more stock, which is always a new issue, technically causing the price to go down(even if it's just a little). So we ignore all the other implications of the idea of ""good employee performance"", but rather only focus on this one aspect of new share issuing.

(positive) Stock split

\--&gt; After a stock split, there is increased liquidity because more people can afford the stock(ex. Google).

(positive) Having a dividend

\--&gt; People will see that a stock pays a dividend and will want to buy it.

(positive) Raising dividend

\--&gt; After they raise the dividend, more people will decide that the stock is now worth their purchase, causing them to buy.

(negative) Lowering dividend

\--&gt; After they lower their dividend, people who currently own shares will decide that the stock is no longer worth it, and will thus sell.

(positive) Ability to get more voting power

\--&gt; Some wealthier businesspeople will buy because they want more voting power either due to (1) their ego; (2) they want to get onto management or board of directors so they get a salary; or (3) they think they can make the company do better in order to cause some of the other events listed in this post to happen, which will make their shares increase in value.

(positive) News that the company is getting bought out

\--&gt; Buying company will buy shares from people at extremely high price once deal goes through

(positive) A corporate raider like Carl Icahn is coming to strip the company of its assets

\--&gt; The corporate raider might make the company pay out dividends/more dividends.

\[These next 3 events are solely based on anticipation of the other events happening\]

(positive and negative) Any other good news that means the company now has more money/potential to gain more money

\--&gt; (+)This means the company might in the future buyback more shares, start paying dividends, or raise current dividends.

\--&gt; (-)This means the company might reward employees more, causing the price to go down.

(negative) Any bad news that means the company now has less money or potential to lose more money

\--&gt; This means the company might issue more shares, lower dividends, or go bankrupt.

(negative) Bankruptcy

\--&gt; Obvious

I believe that currently, Fundamentals are based 90% on the ideas of company performance, and only 10% on this giant list of other Fundamental events.

So why are people ""valuing"" companies based on these concepts of ""future earnings"" and ""liquidation equity"" if you won't get paid till you have great-great-grandchildren? Why does this type of valuation win in the long run? Any success of Technical Analysis makes more sense at this point. My best guess is that it's because it's just always been like that, and people don't want to stop doing something that works. I have no idea when or why people started valuing companies based on money they MIGHT get in the future. But I think that it doesn't matter because I personally would rather live in a world where I can base my purchases on future earnings, since future earnings reflect company performance and furthermore because company performance is easier to predict than predicting when the company will buyback shares or whatever. I prefer this over a world where prices are based only on my giant list and technical analysis."|investing|The market reflects fundamentals to an extent, but still not for the reasons it should|0.0|0.42

Earlier tonight (Feb. 21st, 2022) Russia deployed their troops into 2 regions of Ukraine, that Russia recently labelled the 2 regions as “independent states”.

Last week, the news broke about a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine, which sent the markets tumbling down multiple percentage points within the last hours of the trading day on Feb 17th. However, now the “potential invasion” has turned into an actual invasion (or as Russia calls it “A Peacekeeping Mission”). Stock futures (NASDAQ) is currently down 3.5% with no end in sight.

The TLDR being: inflation was going to run hotter than expected, bond yields would move up, stocks would have to come down, growth stocks would get destroyed and the fed wouldn’t be able to come to the rescue because inflation tied their hands. I suggested value, shorting bond yields and buying internationally. I predicted this would start soon and accelerate early-mid 2022.

I named this upcoming event “**The Great Wheeze**” - a slow slump based on liquidity exiting.

The response back then was this was crazy talk. Inflation was seen as mostly transitory, it’d peak at 5ish%. Markets were pricing in a couple of hikes (now it's 7 this year). Stocks went on a big Santa rally, value was cheap, NASDAQ was firing on all cylinders.

\-----------

First let’s have a look at some of the friendly things people had to say 5 months ago:

&gt;I wonder during how many bubbles throughout history has this theory has been suggested and has it ever once played out?  
&gt;  
&gt;Ivy league economists: ""yeah we really don't know. Its impossible to predict a timeline for such things with any degree of accuracy. Here is a 500 page peer reviewed book to prove our points."" Dude on reddit: "" I've figured it out! T minus 12 months. Guaranteed. Here is 2 paragraphs of garbage to prove my point.""  
&gt;  
&gt;You have no idea what you're talking about and are probably watching too many YouTube videos. I don't know what I'm talking about either, so let's both shut up.  
&gt;  
&gt;What an absolute joke of a post. You don’t even understand basic yield formulas.  
&gt;  
&gt;To everyone else, steer clear of anyone who claims ""certainties"" like this, **ALWAYS**. This guy is leaving out many variables which cannot possibly be predicted and is grossly over-simplifying something as complex as a year+ forecast.  
&gt;  
&gt;High inflation will not happen. The Fed doesn’t control it and its appearance is absolutely not a certainty ; that is what the market is seeing and you’re not.  
&gt;  
&gt;The inflation we are seeing now is purely aggregate demand based, mostly due to high demand and supply chain issues and shortages and the tell tale sign of this is unequal increases  
&gt;  
&gt;You lost me at certain parts but I admire the confidence

\-----------------

Key Themes for 22 and beyond.

We’re entering into a couple years of stagnant growth, shrinking liquidity, increasing real interest rates and declining multiples. **You can’t price in excess or draining liquidity**, liquidity is the tide that all ships rest on.

**The economy is not strong** like Powell, Biden and much of the media crowd say. Blowout deficits and QE have temporarily plastered over underlying weakness.

**Inflation will peak shortly**, but will stabilise higher than pre-COVID (4-5%) for an extended period of time (years). Interest rates will still be negative in real terms and so much cash is floating out there. Central banks will have to be more hawkish going forward, so if the market crashes they'll do less.

At the end of the day the Fed and other central banks are in a bind. They won’t be able to increase interest rates above 3-4% to actually fight it. Even if they could, it’d cause a recession.

**So the only solution is for developed markets is to devalue their currency.** This means extended inflation in developed markets, strengthening emerging market currencies. The era of exporting our inflation to the USD hungry 3rd world is over. [You can already see EM currencies starting to edge up](https://au.investing.com/indices/msci-intl-em-currency).

\----------------

How to play it?

First, **Russia won’t invade Ukraine**, Putin will consolidate his holdings in the rebel regions but won’t go as far as to get hit with real sanctions. A lot of fuss and then things die down. Russian stocks are getting crushed, this is probably close to the absolute bottom so load up on $RSX. Hold for 6 months and make 30%, $RUSL will do better.

With declining multiples and weak customers almost all assets are going to suffer. I think it’s going to be very difficult for the next couple years to do well in anything.

If a 30 PE company growing at 10%/year falls to a 20 PE; it will take 5 years to grow back to even. Rapid growth can negate multiple compression if your entry point is attractive enough.

Growth is going to get oversold, but be careful of what type of growth you buy as most will still struggle. Growth is the answer not value.

Emerging markets are the place to find small, fast growing companies at low valuations. As the inequalities between rich and poor nations are arbitraged away it is a certainty that EM will outperform developed significantly in the long run. Developed markets have mistaken multiple expansion for strength.

Emerging market, smallcap growth in sectors insulated from weaker developed consumption is the sweet spot. Buy in the next 6 months. Look outside China. India, Vietnam, Egypt are all good. India probably the safest but most expensive."|investing|My prediction was correct, the Great Wheeze is here|0.0|0.39

Typically, hedging strategies will employ some form of derivative financial instruments, such as options or futures contracts. During turbulent times in the market such as the one we are in today, hedging can be one of the best ways to protect your portfolio. 

Effective hedging, however, is not easy. Hedging does reduce downside exposure, but it also comes at the risk of limiting upside potential. There is also an inherent risk in hedging for investors who don’t understand the financial instruments involved in the process.

So to get a better understanding of how to effectively hedge downside risk, we decided to do a deep dive into Pershing Square’s track record with defensive hedging. Over the years, Ackman’s hedge fund has made some incredibly successful and lucrative downside bets that have increased investor returns. We wanted to get an idea of Ackman’s hedging strategy, as well as the financial instruments he utilized in each of them.

## Hedging Bet #1

*Time Period: 2005 - 2009 (CDS Hedge)*

*Investment Cost: $64 million*

*Total Proceeds: $1.2 billion*

*Multiple of Capital (MOC): 18.5x*

*Financial Instrument Used: CDS on Bond Issuers (mostly MBIA)*

In 2002, Bill Ackman published a report underlining his short thesis on Municipal Bond insurer MBIA. The report, which was titled “[Is MBIA Triple A?](http://www.briem.com/files/Ackman_MBIA_12092002.pdf)”, provided details on the enormous leverage that was hidden inside MBIA and its subsidiary MBIA Insurance Corp.

Ackman’s short thesis was based on the following factors:

* Municipal Bond Insurance is not a lucrative business model, given that muni-bonds generally have guarantees from the state. Even then, insurance is generally used to lower the interest rate on these bonds. As a result, these insurance premiums were eating into the public money
* MBIA’s accounting was fraudulent and didn’t reflect the risk factors, particularly tied to leverage
* The structured finance products of MBIA were suspect. MBIA aimed to guarantee AAA-rated CDOs, but Wall Street and MBIA was manufacturing these ratings
* The loss of AAA rating would significantly impact MBIA’s ability to remain solvent

Not surprisingly, the report was met with resistance and doubts from all over Wall Street. Before the report was even published, MBIA’s Chairman and CEO Joseph Brown privately met with Ackman. This is what he had to say:

&gt;“You’re a young guy, early in your career. You should think long and hard before issuing the report. We are the largest guarantor of New York state and New York City bonds. In fact, we’re the largest guarantor of municipal debt in the country. Let’s put it this way: We have friends in high places.”

Ackman didn’t step down. He hired a top forensic accounting expert and brought evidence of MBIA’s fraudulent accounting several times to Moody’s. In 2005, Ackman wrote a letter to Moody’s Board of Directors which read:

&gt;“Moody’s AAA rating is so powerful and credible that investors don’t do any due diligence on the underlying credit. Every day that Moody’s incorrectly maintains an AAA rating on MBIA, these extremely risk-averse investors unwittingly buy bonds that are not deserving of Moody’s AAA rating.”

In addition to shorting the stock of MBIA, Ackman also purchased CDS, or Credit Default Swaps on MBIA’s debt. These swaps act as insurance in the case of credit events or solvency risks that the issuer of the debt may face. In exchange, the buyer is forced to pay annual premiums to the seller.

The premiums that Ackman paid on his MBIA CDS position put a massive drag on his overall returns for many years. Finally, in February of 2008, MBIA cut its dividend and suspended its structured finance activities. In June of the same year, MBIA and Ambac, the two largest municipal bond insurers, lost their AAA rating from Moody’s, and Ackman walked away with $1.2 billion of proceeds from the trade.\*

This particular bet showed Ackman’s conviction in his position, despite having dealt with criticism and drag on returns for many years. As Whitney Wilson, Co-Manager of T2 Partners, put it:

&gt;“For five years he was wrong, wrong, wrong. Then he made billions… He is the most relentlessly stubborn person on the planet.”

## Hedging Bet #2

*Time Period: 2020*

*Investment Cost: $27 million*

*Total Proceeds: $2.6 billion*

*Multiple of Capital (MOC): 96.3x*

*Financial Instrument Used: Index CDS on Investment Grade and High Yield Bonds*

After a few years of underperformance relative to the S&amp;P due to positions such as Herbalife and Valeant Pharmaceuticals, Bill Ackman entered the financial limelight once again in 2020.

In February of 2020, Ackman began to worry about a pandemic-related economic recession. His hedge fund bought insurance policy through CDS on almost $71 billion worth of corporate debt, including $44.5 billion of U.S investment-grade bonds, $23.1 billion of an equivalent European index, and a $3.1 billion notional exposure to Europe’s high yield debt.

This bet was risky, to say the least, and required an enormous level of conviction due to the volatility it imposed on the fund’s portfolio. At its peak, this one position accounted for almost 40% of Pershing Square’s entire AUM. On March 13, when the S&amp;P jumped 10%, the value of the contracts had dropped by $800 million in just one day.

By the time Ackman appeared on CNBC on March 18, he had sold about half of the defensive hedge position. He then went on to use the proceeds to buy into many of his existing positions, while also adding a new position in the coffee chain Starbucks. As of March 31, Pershing Square had not only offset all the losses on their long-equity positions but had actually ended the quarter with substantial gains relative to the S&amp;P

One of the underappreciated aspects that allowed Ackman to pursue such a bold strategy lies in the unique structure of his hedge fund. In 2014, Pershing Square publicly-listed itself on the Euronext Amsterdam - the Netherlands stock market. So while a lot of hedge funds were facing capital calls from investors during the pandemic-related scare, Ackman had the resource of permanent capital. It is safe to say that he made good use of this opportunity. 

## Hedging Bet #3

*Time Period: Late 2020 - 2022 (Ongoing)*

*Investment Cost: $188 million*

*Total Proceeds: $1.4 billion*

*Multiple of Capital (MOC): 7.4x*

*Financial Instrument Used: OTM 2Yr and 10Yr Swaptions*

Towards the end of 2020, Pershing Square came to the conclusion that interest rates would substantially rise throughout the next few years. The thesis for this position was fueled by the policy decisions of the Federal Reserve and the U.S government.

As of December 2020, the unemployment rate was nearly 6.7% with CPI inflation at 1.4%. Due to QE and stimulus, Ackman was expecting both metrics to take substantial turns for the rest of 2021. By the end of 2021, this prediction turned out to be right, with unemployment falling to 3.9% as of December 2021 and CPI inflation ramping up to almost 7.0%.

To hedge against interest rate risk, Pershing Square purchased out-of-the-money interest rate swaptions starting towards the end of 2020. In January of 2021, they sold nearly 90% of the market value of the position, generating about $1.25 billion in proceeds. Since then, they have replaced this hedge with an additional longer-dated out-of-the-money swaption. 

Swaptions, which stand for swap options, is a type of options contract which gives the buyer the right to enter into a swap contract on a specified date. These options are generally purchased in the over-the-counter market and are not traded on an exchange. This requires both the buyer and the seller to mutually agree on the notional amount, time period, and the fixed/floating rates involved with the instrument.

Swaptions come in two forms: payer swaptions and receiver swaptions. The payer swaption gives you the right to pay a fixed rate and receive a floating rate of interest, usually the LIBOR rate. On the other hand, a receiver swaption is exactly the opposite.

To use an example, a borrower with loans maturing sometime within the next year might want to purchase payer swaptions to hedge against any substantial interest rate movement. If the variable interest rate, which is tied to LIBOR, moves above the fixed interest rate that was agreed upon, then the borrower would want to exercise the contract to pay the fixed rate instead.

## Takeaways and Lessons

From studying Bill Ackman and Pershing Square’s track record of defensive hedging, there were 3 main lessons that we walked away with:

1. Only take bets in which you have large convictions. The market will often remain irrational longer than you would expect, or longer than you can remain solvent in many cases.
2. Look for bets with asymmetric payouts. This means limited upfront carrying costs and investments with opportunities to generate large multiples on your capital. This also means investments with a limited downside in cases where the potential risk does not transpire
3. Hedging is more lucrative on a short-term basis where the monetization of it can become a funding source for cheap equities during downturns. Continuous hedging strategies do work, but they will often put a drag on overall returns."|investing|Bill Ackman's Best Defensive Hedges|33.0|0.77

I wanted to better understand the math on margin loans if used as a cash loan. All the examples on the internet assume margin is being used to buy more securities when instead I want to use as an emergency fund . Let's assume 50% initial margin and 25% maintenance margin and a 100k taxable brokerage account in VTSAX.

So I can borrow up to 50% of the asset value in margin, which means I can take out a 50k loan? Usually if you invest the margin in VTSAX as well it is a 100k but since this is a cash loan the amount is lower right? Next the investor own money must comprise of at least 25% of the security value. In a typical example of buying 100k assets with 50k margin and 50k cash, the margin call would happen if the asset value feel below 66.7k. That is true here as well with our 100k cash / 50k cash loan example as well, right? So if VTSAX fell 33% I would have a margin call.

Please let me know if my math is incorrect. Thanks a lot

Does QT lead to bear steepening or bear flattening? i.e. when QT starts, would you go long 10Y-3M (or 10Y-2Y) spread or short it?

Background:
So during QE, the fed buys shit ton of long tenor treasuries like 10Y and beyond. So QT would imply that the Fed will sell off these treasuries. So wouldn't this imply that 10Y yields will go up around QT and lead to bear steepening? However whenever I read online, it always points to the idea that QT leads to bear flattening i.e. short term yields go even further up, compared to long term yields.

One reason I could think for that - when the Fed bought 10Y bonds for QE sometime ago, those bonds now are not 10Y but say 8Y maturities since time passed by lol. So effectively they will be selling off slightly lower tenor maturity. But then this is not a very strong argument since the maturity wont change by much. So the confusion still remains, why wouldn't QT lead to bear steepening?    

So I guess the question is, is the FF rate hike more strong in its impact than selling off of long tenor treasuries. This is bcs QT will happen during the rate hike cycle."|investing|Will QT lead to bear steepening or bear flattening?|0.0|0.5

I want to support (and, if possible, reward) companies that engage in ethical practices, and punish those that are willfully unethical.  I know that one thing I can do is vote my shares, but I'm a small time investor and my 5-10 shares in a given company don't mean much if I'm opposed by top execs who have more shares in the company than I have digits in my bank account.

I have around 45k in debt not including my house. Relatively low interest. Not really a burden on the overall budget. 

My wife and I would like to do about 100k in remodeling. Kitchen, Deck, and roof. 

I’ve been considering getting a home equity loan, not heloc of about 150k. 4.49% payments would be around 1500 for 10 years. 

My current payment on all the debts listed above is 1200 a month. 

With the interest on the loan being tax deductible and the rate being slightly lower than historical returns in the market, is there any reason not to do the loan?

If I didn’t do the loan, I wouldn’t pay off the debt listed above. I would just pay for the projects with my net gain. 

And lastly since this project would be taking place awhile after I get the money and take awhile to complete since I’m doing it myself, is there anyplace to invest the money and use the gains monthly to finance it so it’s just not sitting there? Somewhere other than stocks.

For example if trillions of dollars are being printed and a large percentage of that is pumping up stocks and mostly making rich people richer and sitting in their bank accounts and not being spent, the money in those cases will be low velocity and have a low inflationary pressure. 
On the other hand the money being handed out by governments in the form of stimulus cheques will be spent on goods and services and have a high inflationary effect. I'm guessing that although this is a substantial figure it is nowhere near as much as the new money that is making up Elon musk's net worth and that won't be getting spent, for another example.

Years where the return was exactly 8% to 10% : 1959 1965 2004 2016

When parsed this way, its fairly straightforward to see that when you add up all of the times it was under 8% and put that together with all the times it was over 10% that it balances out to 8%-10%. However, actually getting the 8% to 10% is a rare occurrence, happening only four times over the past century.

Four!

This is one of those counter intuitive things about stats. Kind of like how if a medical test is 99% accurate and your test is positive that does not mean you have a 99% chance of having the condition. Or like how it can be the case that for women medicine A is better than medicine B and for men medicine A is better than medicine B but together for the population as a whole medicine B is better than medicine A. Its just ""common sense"" that if an average is 8% to 10% then that should mean that 8% to 10% is the most common happening. But it does not work that way.

I know I am shouting into the void here. No matter what I say or do it is not going to stop the flow of people thinking that the S&amp;P is a sure bet to return 8% to 10%. But I just had to say something to get it out of my system."|investing|The paradox that the stock market on average will return 8% to 10% but will not return 8% to 10% on average.|1848.0|0.82

Full Text:

&gt;Shares of Palantir fell more than 13% on Thursday afternoon after the company reported mixed earnings results for the fourth quarter.

&gt;Here are the key numbers:

&gt;Earnings per share (EPS): 2 cents, adjusted vs. 4 cents estimated, according to a Refinitiv survey of analysts
&gt;Revenue: $433 million vs. $418 million estimated, according to Refinitiv
&gt;Palantir said it expects $443 million in revenue in the first quarter, while analysts had been expecting about $439 million, according to Refinitiv. It continues to expect annual revenue growth of 30% or more through 2025.

&gt;But its reported net loss was $156.19 million, wider than the $148.34 million of the fourth quarter in 2020.

&gt;The software company, known for its work with government agencies, said that revenue increased 26% year over year and that it added 34 net new customers in the fourth quarter.

&gt;It also said it closed 64 deals in the quarter of $1 million or more, including 27 of which were at least $5 million and 19 of which were at least $10 million.

&gt;Palantir expanded its commercial business throughout 2021, with revenue up 34% year over year to $645 million. U.S. commercial revenue alone soared 102% with the customer count jumping 4.7 times to 80. In 2021, government revenue gained 47% to $897 million.

Personal take: Honestly I don't know what would turn investor sentiment on this company at this point. Revenue growth is no longer sufficient without improvement in profitability and cashflow. If the current momentum continues it won't be long for the stock to get below its original IPO price at $10.

What I dont understand is this:   
1. The above assertion is true in the case when investors were interested only in fixed income products. So US bonds, treasuries, etc., will become cheaper with higher rates, and they're safer so they're better options than EM fixed income products.   
2. But if you look at risk assets like equities, they'd perform poorly in US because of higher interest rates since credit will become expensive, and higher inflation is already punishing consumers and affecting their buying power. So for equity, EM might perform way better than the US.   

So   
1. why would investors not prefer shifting capital from US equities to EM equities?   
2. Wouldn't that somewhat offset the effect of capital flowing from EM fixed income to US fixed income?   
3. I see FIIs selling off their equity portfolio in EM markets, which I find a little confusing.   

One reason to explain FIIs selling off Indian equities is that Indian listed companies might be dependent on US companies for revenues since India is a net exporter, so that ripple effect might touch them as well. Secondly, if a lot of fixed income capital flows out of India, that will cause the INR to depreciate in front of the dollar, and net equity returns for international investors in dollar terms will go down.

There is a lot of uncertainty around inflation, supply shortages, and corporate profits. To try to figure out what the hell is going on, I looked into the ""first"" real commodities shortage that made the news - lumber, a year ago.

[LBS](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/commodities/lbs) is currently near May ATH's. Keep this in mind.

* Now it's pretty obvious lumber shortages were due to [Wildfires on the west coast](https://www.capitalpress.com/ag_sectors/timber/why-is-there-a-lumber-shortage-in-the-u-s/article_70382602-54fc-11eb-a16b-934c0ae1c18f.html) (No ad [version](https://web.archive.org/web/20210202010056/https://www.capitalpress.com/ag_sectors/timber/why-is-there-a-lumber-shortage-in-the-u-s/article_70382602-54fc-11eb-a16b-934c0ae1c18f.html)), wiping out wood supply at the source.

* Or is it? Lumber shortages were actually because of [COVID-19 restrictions](https://fortune.com/2021/03/20/lumber-prices-2021-chart-when-will-wood-shortage-end-price-of-lumber-go-down-home-sales-cost-update-march/) at the sawmills, without a doubt. Sawmills are working at reduced capacity - we should see declining profits for these folks.

* Actually, it's due to the [mountain pine beetle](https://web.archive.org/web/20210702170646/https://qz.com/), which infested BC forests, causing massive effects of damage and causing forests to need to regrow.

* No, really. It's actually not a supply-side issue at all - lumber prices got here through [massive demand coming from people creating at-home workspaces](https://www.probuilder.com/blog/look-lumber-prices-supply-side) and moving out to rural areas.

* That's nonsense, obviously. The real contributor is [US tariffs on wood import from Canada](https://web.archive.org/web/20210519002332/https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-are-home-prices-soaring-11617834557), which has been plaguing us for years.

* But these reasons are all wrong, of course. The *real* reason there's a shortage is because of [chemical shortages](https://www.woodworkingnetwork.com/news/woodworking-industry-news/chemical-shortages-limited-freight-capacities-reduce-wood-adhesive) from Texas winter storms leading to a [shortage of resin](https://wjactv.com/news/local/lumber-prices-skyrocket-as-shortage-continues), which is integral for plywood.

* Ha - fooled ya. It's nothing to do with lumber production, it's actually all [transportation related](https://cnr.ncsu.edu/news/2021/05/lumber-shortage/).

### Why should I care?

Even if you're not personally invested in lumber, there is a really concerning reason to care about it.

The vibe you should get above isn't ""gee, that must have been a perfect storm."" It's that no one actually knows what the hell is going on, and why we're basically back to ATH's a year after the ""shortage"" has been resolved.

Articles will look for a plausible reason, latch onto it, and feed it to you as if it's obvious. The above should make it abundantly clear that there was **no** consensus or transparency into why lumber evaporated for months on end.

While sawmills were working at ""reduced capacity"", the combined net profits of the five largest publicly traded North American lumber producers (Canfor in British Columbia; Interfor in British Columbia; Resolute Forest Products in Montreal; West Fraser Timber in British Columbia; and Seattle-based Weyerhaeuser) somehow... [jumped a staggering 2,218%](https://fortune.com/2021/11/18/sawmill-profits-soared-bursting-lumber-bubble-bringing-them-back-down/#:~:text=For%20the%20third%20quarter%20of,down%2069%25%20to%20%241.1%20billion.).

**Pros for Realty Income**: new exposure to the gaming industry, increased market share in a prime area in the northeast, partnership with an industry leader, consistent and low risk rental income for the longterm, and no worry about handling operations due to the nature of the lease

**Pros for Wynn:** immediate recognition of $1.7 billion USD, continued use of the site and options to expand, retention of its Mass. Gaming Commission license (one of two in the state whereas the other is owned by competitor MGM), partnership with an industry leader, a lower rent with flexible land use for thirty (30) year period with optional renewal as it attempts to grow customer base

**Cons**: Wynn assumes all expenses related to tax, insurance, maintenance, etc. on top of rent due to the nature of the lease, Wynn faces brutal in-state and regional competition with MGM Springfield, Twin Rivers, Plainridge Park, and tribally-owned powerhouses Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun Casinos

My take is that this is good for longterm investors of both companies and allows them to continue in their respective expertise rather than meddling in the unknown.  My concern remains, ""an hour drive and I'm at Foxwoods and Mohegan,"" which are behemoths in their own right.

- 30% Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI)

- 15% iShares 7 – 10 Year Treasury ETF (IEF)

This is attractive to me as basically a better savings account that I can draw from for big purchases. I'll take 5% over 0.015% (Swiss banks rn) any day for that small of a risk.

But I can only save $500 a month, and we still pay transaction fees here (starting from $20). So with the smaller allocations, the fees would eat up a significant portion of each buy.

I have checked out the popular Degiro and IB, and have to say I don't like their offerings enough to give up the peace of mind of using a Swiss bank (with a physical location, customer service, etc.) They're not exactly feeless either (though cheaper), but I don't really get a trustworthy vibe.

So, is there an ETF tracking this kind of allocation that I could buy instead? Otherwise all I can do is save up that money to make annual buys instead."|investing|"Is there an ETF emulating the ""All Weather Portfolio"" (See post)?"|12.0|0.8

This is simply a discussion of observations by experts in the field about where we are right now with equities and the potential risks and impacts ahead based on leading indicators and forward-looking metrics that are themselves subject to certain risks.**

John Rekenthaler, VP of Research at Morningstar, notes that there are three major declines that have already presaged a 2000-like crash:

1. Speculators (e.g. Cathie Wood's ARKK).
2. Small-growth stocks.
3. Large-growth stocks.

As Rekenthaler notes in his recent piece ""[The Stock Market's Dominoes Are Falling](https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1076351/the-stock-markets-dominoes-are-falling)"", published in the *Rekenthaler Report* at Morningstar Investment Research:

&gt;On Jan. 5 of this year, my former Morningstar colleague John Coumarianos published a highly prescient article. Noting that that the small-growth indexes were drooping, with the most aggressive of such indexes performing the worst, John wondered whether such behavior was the proverbial canary in the coal mine. The last time small-growth companies so badly trailed other stocks, he points out, was early 2000. Shortly thereafter, blue-chip growth stocks also turned belly-up.  
&gt;  
&gt;As they have since done.

By other metrics there's a certain number I keep coming back to, and it's more generous than Rekenthaler's note that profitability in the aftermath of 2000 eroded by 50%.

Whether we look at the premium to nominal Market-to-GDP, or we look at CAPE Ratio, or we look at the pre pandemic valuations of major companies in the index as an indicator of what mean reversion looks like, I think we're looking at 40% every which way.

Does that mean it will happen?  Not necessarily, no.  I'm not a prognosticator.  But it does mean that if the interest rate hikes in March and beyond do cause companies to revise 2022 forecast once they understand the full impact of Fed actions on cost of capital, we could be looking at a decline that extends well into 2023."|investing|The Canaries in the Coal Mine: Brief Observations On The Retreat From Growth|29.0|0.71

&gt;Airbnb beat Wall Street estimates on earnings and revenue in its fourth quarter, as the travel company continued to rebound from the Covid-19 pandemic.

&gt;The company’s stock jumped more than 7% in after hours trading.

&gt;Here are the key numbers:

&gt;Earnings per share: 8 cents vs. 3 cents expected in a Refinitiv survey of analysts
&gt;Revenue: $1.53 billion vs. $1.46 billion expected by Refinitiv
&gt;Airbnb expects first-quarter 2022 nights and experiences booked to significantly exceed Q1 2019 levels. It estimates revenue to fall between $1.41 billion and $1.48 billion in the first quarter of 2022, topping analyst estimates of $1.24 billion.

&gt;The company reported 73.4 million nights and experiences booked in the fourth quarter, down nearly 8% from the prior quarter and missing estimates. Analysts were expecting 74.96 million nights and experiences for the quarter, according to StreetAccount. Still, the figure is up 59% year-over-year, when the Covid-19 pandemic weighed heavily on the travel industry.

&gt;Airbnb said in its fourth-quarter letter to shareholders that it has rebounded quickly from the impacts of the pandemic. The company said the negative effects of omicron on bookings and cancellations were lower than it experienced with the delta variant. Gross nights booked in December were up more than 40% compared to 2020, the company said.

&gt;“Despite the continued near-term uncertainties, we see evidence of strong pent-up demand: as of the end of January 2022, we had over 25% more nights booked for the summer travel season than at this time in 2019,” the company wrote.

&gt;Revenue for the fourth quarter came in at $1.5 billion, up 78% year over year. Airbnb reported $55 million in net income, its first Q4 profit. It’s a decrease from the prior quarter but a huge improvement from the $3.89 billion net loss it posted in Q4 2020.

&gt;Gross booking value, which Airbnb uses to track host earnings, service fees, cleaning fees and taxes, totaled $11.3 billion in the fourth quarter, slightly over Wall Street estimates of $11.08 billion, according to StreetAccount.

&gt;Average daily rates rose 20% from a year ago to $154 in the fourth quarter.

&gt;Airbnb has spent much of its time focusing on a sort of “travel revolution,” as remote work becomes a more permanent option for many across the U.S.

&gt;As a result, Airbnb said average trip length during the past two years increased by about 15%, with stays of more than seven days now representing nearly half of all gross nights booked. Meantime, long-term stays of 28 nights or more continued to be its fastest-growing category by trip length. Those extended stays accounted for 22% of gross nights booked in the fourth quarter, up 16% from Q4 2019.

&gt;The company said it had its greatest number of listings yet, but did not provide a figure.

Shares are up 5% in AH.

Personal take: I personally remain bullish on Airbnb, and I think they are one of the companies that will strongly benefit from a post-Covid travel surge worldwide.

I decided today that i am going to start investing my money. I am 24 year old, live in Finland, and right now i work as cleaner. I earn approximately 2000 euros a month. All my expenses are almost 700 euros a month. Excluded food (i live alone so i dont eat that much).

&amp;#x200B;

 At the moment, I plan to invest in three different places.  

* S-Bank Asset Management 100 A fond
* Invictus Capital Crypto10 Hedged fond 
* Vanguard FTSE All-World index

&amp;#x200B;

S-Bank is my official bank where my salary comes every month.  I chose their fund to make it easier for me to get a house loan in the future. 

&amp;#x200B;

 Nowadays, you are not an investor if you do not invest in crypto.  I chose Invictus Capital because that way I can easily invest in the top 10 cryptocurrencies. 

The fund dynamically adjusts its crypto exposure using an algorithm developed by their talented data science team to reduce volatility and improve returns. The fund aims to avoid drawdowns by moving into interest-bearing cash holdings during bear markets, and pivoting back into crypto once the bulls return. ( I copied this text from their page). 

&amp;#x200B;

The last one is  - the Vanguard FTSE All-World Index.

 This is my main fund in which I want to invest regularly and for a long time.

&amp;#x200B;

 My strategy is to invest 100 euros every week. 

* 25 euros to S-Bank
* 25 euros to Crypto10 
* 50 euros to Vanguard 

&amp;#x200B;

 I have already made an emergency fund for myself. Which I use only if something should happen.

 I only invest as much as I am willing to lose.

So what’s this little known investment that the Batman himself shills?](https://youtu.be/F_MYms0wUmQ?t=1) Savings bonds! You heard me right, savings bonds, [specifically Series I savings bonds which pay interest linked directly to the current inflation rate](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ibonds/res_ibonds.htm). The interest rate on I-Bonds [right now is 7.12](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/products/prod_ibonds_glance.htm)%! That’s a US government security that pays a multitude higher interest than any bank and more than most blue chip corporate bonds are yielding right now. The interest rate on I Bonds is adjusted to reflect the inflation rate every 6 months. At certain points, the Treasury department will also sell I-bonds that have a second additional fixed interest portion to the I-Bond’s yield, however as of right now this fixed interest portion is set at 0% so any I-bonds bought right now are tied directly to the inflation rate only. [Unlike TIPS securities sold by the Treasury department, the principal of an I-Bond stays fixed (TIPS lose value when deflation occurs). The interest rate on an I-bond will never go below 0% in the event of deflation](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/products/prod_tipsvsibonds.htm). I-Bonds can be purchased directly from the US Government via its [TreasuryDirect website](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/tdhome.htm).

So, as with anything on here, the question becomes, what’s the catch? There is in fact a limit on the amount of I-Bonds you can purchase, $10,000 in electronic I-bonds per year can be bought through the government’s treasury direct website. [You can also separately buy up to $5,000 in paper I Bonds by electing on your tax return to receive your tax refund in I-Bonds.](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/faq/faq_irstaxfeature.htm) Finally, and most importantly, you must hold I-bonds for at least 1 year prior to being able to cash them in and any I-Bond redeemed prior to 5 years from the date of issue loses the three months of interest preceding the redemption. Unlike some other treasuries, the bonds also cannot be resold to other investors. I do not currently hold any series I Bonds."|investing|Want to hedge against inflation? Holy savings bonds Batman!

Maybe others can offer some insight on this, but I think we need to look at a couple other things in addition to earnings. Let's look at the all-time high for the Shiller, which was 44 right before the dot com bust in Feb/March 2000.

In early 2000 we had:

1. Average corporate AAA bond yield at 7.6% with inflation running at around 3.2%
2. Unemployment rate at 4.0%

In early 2022 we have

1. Average corporate AAA bond yield at around 3% with inflation running at 7.5%
2. Unemployment rate at 3.9%

So we can easily see that if one were to pull his money out of equities, there simply isn't anywhere else to put the money. Corporate bonds look terrible because of awful yields and inflation, and are vulnerable to rate hikes. This was not the case in 2000, where one could dump his money into PIMCO funds and ride out the crash in equities.

Now some will say ""put money into real estate""! --well that sector is in an even worse bubble than stocks, and there is a building shortage, rising property taxes etc. Going from one overheated sector on the verge of a crash or correction and into another ins't a solution.

At the end of the day, it needs to be a massive crisis in the financial markets and doomsday before I sell all my stocks and hold cash or bonds, which will guarantee I lose (lots) of money. Municipals are better, but yields are still below inflation

And they are rarely compatible between fabs because of different materials, technologies, etc. Not everything is standardized.

So going back the headwinds that the semiconductor sector is supposed to be having: are we talking about certain types of companies only? Fabs seem to have huge backlogs, but everybody else suffers from price increases and huge delays. What are your thoughts?"|investing|Investing in semiconductor companies|21.0|0.87

The Securities and Exchange Commission has sent subpoenas to firms including Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. as well as several hedge funds, asking for trading records and information about the investors’ communications with bankers, some of the people said. The Justice Department also is investigating the matter, some of the people said.

Investigators are looking at whether bankers improperly alerted favored clients to the sales before they were publicly disclosed and whether the funds benefited from the information—for example by shorting the shares in question. (In a short sale, an investor sells borrowed stock in hopes of buying it back at a lower price later and pocketing the difference.)

Block trades are a big business on Wall Street that has gotten even bigger of late. There were nearly $70 billion of them in the U.S. in 2021, a five-year high, according to Dealogic. Morgan Stanley, an early focus of the probe, was the most active bank last year, leading more than a quarter of the deals by value and earning more than $300 million in fees, Dealogic data show. Goldman is also a big player in the business.

In recent years, the block-trading business has boomed because of record volumes of initial public offerings and other deals such as secondary or follow-on offerings, as stock markets soared. Block trades often occur, for instance, when lockup windows that prevent insiders from selling for a time after an IPO expire.

# Euronext ([ENX.PA](https://ENX.PA)) Write up

For the financial information, models, and ratios use, these were pulled from [here](https://www.financialstockdata.com/). These differ sometimes a bit per site. 

1. **Business Model:**

The company offers a range of stock exchange and business services, including securities quotations, cash and derivatives trading, and the dissemination of market data. It is simply an exchange, but it also provides services to other exchanges such as software maintenance, software licensing, and trading software in the form of managed services.

Euronext has several subsidiaries within Europe that they manage. However, they also have subsidiaries in Malta, India, United States. They buy up other exchanges and grow this way. Because they have already built a good infrastructure for the exchanges they have bought, they can run the bought exchange cheaper (cost reduction through economy of scale). Their revenue is divided among the following segments:

* *Listing (15,4%)*
* *Trading Revenue (37%)*
* *Investor Services (0.8%)*
* *Advanced Data Services (14.7%)*
* *Post-Trade (26%)*
* *Euronext Technology Solutions &amp; Other (6.2%)*

(source: [https://www.euronext.com/en/investor-relations/financial-information/financial-reports](https://www.euronext.com/en/investor-relations/financial-information/financial-reports))

**Sector** \*\*Industry:\*\*Financial Services Financial Data &amp; Stock Exchanges

2. **Category (Peter Lynch):**

*Stalwarts:*

The company is currently growing organically by 5% (from annual reports, CAGR) and is buying up other exchanges in order to expand and thus increase their moat.

(source: [https://www.euronext.com/en/investor-relations/financial-information/financial-reports](https://www.euronext.com/en/investor-relations/financial-information/financial-reports))

Definition Stalwarts:

A large, well-established company that still offers long-term growth potential.

3. **Financial Position/ Profitability**

ROIC 7 % (dalende trend)i , Net Profit Margin (+- 30% over 5 jaar),

D/E: Around 1.5 with ROE of 30/25%, Current Ratio (1.05), Quick Ratio (1.05). Considering the number of acquisitions they make, their debt and liabilities are not bad. Fine balance sheet in general.

4. **Management**

* **Outstanding Shares**

Outstanding shares have been increasing with the LSEG (London Stock Exchange) aquisition from 76 to 92 million shares. They have not announced a buyback program and so they diluted shareholders. 

&amp;#x200B;

* **Compensation (CEO)**

The CEO's salary has increased in relation to earnings. Except in 2019 when it increases while earnings decline. Furthermore, in relative terms, salary rises slightly faster than company earnings.

(Source: [https://simplywall.st/stocks/fr/diversified-financials/epa-enx/euronext-shares/news/why-we-think-euronext-nvs-epaenx-ceo-compensation-is-not-exc](https://simplywall.st/stocks/fr/diversified-financials/epa-enx/euronext-shares/news/why-we-think-euronext-nvs-epaenx-ceo-compensation-is-not-exc))

* **Dividend**

At the time of writing the company has a Dividend Yield of 1.7%, a payout ratio of \~30% ( differs per site a bit, did not manually calculate it). It has not risen continuously they have lowered it in 2018.

5. **Moat: Competitive advantage**

*Efficient Scale/Scale Economics*

The moat that Euronext has is the Efficient Scale/Scale Economics. They have a large infrastructure and distribution network with which they reduce costs when they take over an exchange. And new exchanges in a country are not really set up.

6. **Intrinsic Value**

**Macro Economische Factoren**

With the low-interest rates, **Euronext** is currently benefiting from the fact that more ""savers"" will try their luck on the stock market. This means more trades in the shares and that, of course, results in higher turnover for the ""Trading Revenue"" segment. If ECB were to raise interest rates, this could of course result in fewer trades and thus less trading volume. At the time of writing, 47 percent of their revenue is dependent on trading volume. A market correction or crash is part of the bear case when you look at that.

**Discounted EPS**

I have determined an EPS-based intrinsic value on the organic growth that the company expects so without acquisitions. This is to get an idea, market conditions are clearly one of the risk factors of the company. I always use a discount rate of 10 percent, here I used a growth rate of 4 percent, and a terminal value of 12. The value then comes down to 58 euros, while the share is priced at 82 euros. With this value, there is currently no Margin of Safety. Also given the market conditions now, keep in mind that this is a conservative valuation as it is only based on organic growth. I think it is a very interesting company and I will certainly put it on my watchlist, but for the moment I do not see a Margin of Safety in it.

In the event of a market correction or crash, this could certainly be a real bargain for me if the market reacts even more to the then-prevailing fall in volume-based sales and profits (IPOs are also almost non-existent then, of course).

**Do not forget with DCF's you have a lot of freedom** in what you choose, that is why they can differ a lot and that is why I always do it conservatively, it gives you an idea what you should pay for a company or when it is a bit too much and that is great. But the number is not exact. You can see it more as eyeballing and it depends on how well you know the company how much growth you think you can put in.

Granted, it’s truly a complex situation but are fed interest rate adjustments also more of a placebo effect on inflation?

I posted this a while back, got thrashed in the comments and it was downvoted into oblivion.  Hopefully we can have a rational conversation about this stock that is absolutely ripping right now. 

Currently I’m up about 30% on my $2k position (options) and if (or when) BBW hits 30+ I’ll be about +$13,000 according to options calculator. The target atm is $30 and it’s been upgraded recently to a strong buy by fidelity and has been picked up by a few news sources as a stock to watch. 

The amount of news that’s coming out has been a little tough to keep up with. Months ago BBW upgraded their guidance and they estimate they’re going to triple their EPS and have the most profitable quarter in company history. Tbh, their revenue numbers and their balance sheet is the sketchiest part about this company. The new CEO has been making a ton of new initiatives and they’ll be in a position to pay off their debt if things keep going positive for them. 

https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/BBW/build-a-bear-workshop/revenue

TLDR: they’re making new partnerships and releasing limited edition and special bears and their most recent thing is that they have a special “after dark” line only available online…. at what looks like high margins and same day delivery. And within the last week they were voted one of the best places to work by Forbes yet again. 

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/forbes-recognizes-build-bear-workshop-160000796.html

They’re now marketing to every generation with their after dark and limited edition bears and they’re able to capture a larger segment of the market. This gives them access to more wallets and higher ceiling for overall market share. Two other facts to consider is that their Price/Book is incredibly low for the industry  (specialty retail: around 4) and the size of the float is actually incredibly small at 16,000,000. The stock pops up around February 14th already and when they put out their earnings report on 3/8…. Your guess is as good as mine about how high it goes.

As usual, I am writing this to (a) bounce around ideas and (b) have something written down to check my own self-selective biases and to evaluate my track record as an investor EOY.

I was long in O&amp;G for 2020 (bought XOM at around $32\*), rode the Delta Wave in 2021, saw a possibility of making a few extra percentages during Omicron. So I exited O&amp;G, shorted them, exited the shorts and then re-entered on the long side. As oil equities have risen around 10-30% YTD, I am again faced with the question: **""what now?""**

* \*As WTI rose, the risk curve of investing in oil equities shift leftward. To maintain my risk appetite and return, I started transitioning to more levered bets on oil (so XOM to OXY, PDS, OVV). The downside of this is that these names are more sensitive to WTI movement both ups and downs, within a range.

**Valuation-wise,** O&amp;G equities are still quite attractive compared to where WTI is. Depending on the stickers and where WTI will be in the next 6 months (as long as it stays btw $65-75/bbl), I think o&amp;g equities have another 10-50% run from here. If bad comes to worse, it's still likely that o&amp;g will yield between 10-30% FCF for 2022, absent a recession.

**WTI price-wise**, $90/bbl WTI, if adjusted for inflation, is actually only equal to about $72 in 2010. Expenses associated with energy consumption as a percentage of GDP per capita (60k today vs. 48k in 2010) are also not outrageous. Unlike most of the oil bulls, I expect the break-even price will rise with inflation as costs of labor and new equipment rise, at least in the short term. If break-even rises to $65/bbl, that $90 WTI doesn't seem so outrageous anymore.

**Supply-demand imbalance**, there is a considerable consensus among heads of commodity traders of the big banks (with a vocal minority of opposing views) that we're still in the early innings of an energy supercycle. Also, the IEA recently [published their report pushing back their previous timeline of when supply will outstrip demand](https://www.iea.org/reports/oil-market-report-february-2022). FWIW, the above views are the market's views.

* I continue to have a middle-of-the-road view btw the two extremes presented by the mega bulls and bears of oil. Conservatively, I think it's safe to say that WTI will continue to stay rangebound btw $65-75/bbl for 2022. However, I expect US shales will become a significant player again and supply will start outstripping demand in 2H2022.
* As such, I have and continue to position my portfolio toward O&amp;G servicers and equipment. Historically, the servicers' profitability lagged the producers by about 18 months. At this point, I am fairly confident that this pattern will repeat this time, absent a recession.

**Mass-psychology wise**, I continue to think we're in the very early innings of mass euphoria in O&amp;G. There is little to no pumping of O&amp;G in [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) or [r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/). When there is mentioning, it's usually household names like XOM or CVX. I joke that I will know that we reach peak euphoria when retail starts peddling pre-revenue O&amp;G names. I don't invest based on the assumption that others will become irrational, but it informs my decision of when to take profit.

**In conclusion**, depending on what happens between now and EOY, I plan to take profit in the O&amp;G producers sometime in 2H2022.

O&amp;G moves fast and things can change in the blink of an eye. As usual, I reserve the option to change my thesis as events unfold (will update if I do).

And history suggests that in ""bubbly"" markets like we have today, market peaks happen when the yield curve inverts.   This may offer useful signs to watch for to know when to run for the hills.

[Graph 1](https://i.imgur.com/ZPGOiiU.png):  Based on its trajectory over the last ~4 months, the yield curve appears to be heading for an inversion by summer, assuming something doesn't change its trajectory (and to be fair, it could).  Yield curve inversions almost always presage a recession 6-18 months later (average of 15.1 months according to Bank of America).  

[Graph 2](https://i.imgur.com/N1PV6TY.png):   The only exceptions in the last century was a false positive in 1965, and the Great Depression/World War 2 era when the Fed was actively manipulating rates to stabilize the economy and fund the war effort.

[Graph 3](https://i.imgur.com/yMbbJwz.png):  The Fed rate tends to peak or plunge when the yield curve inverts.   Given that it is poised to invert by summer, and [CME FedWatch](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html) is currently predicting the Fed rate will be ~1.25-1.50%, the current tightening cycle may not make it to 2%.   This is important, because in previous recessions, the Fed has lowered rates by ~5% when a recession hits to stimulate the economy.  You can't do that when rates are 1.5%. 

[Graph 4](https://i.imgur.com/dYQkQuA.png)/[Graph 5](https://i.imgur.com/dPgF40S.png):  These compare the yield curve with stocks (as shown by the detrended S&amp;P 500) and housing prices (as shown by real Case-Shiller HPI).  For ""bubbly"" markets like stocks in 2000/2008 and homes in 1989/2007, yield curve inversions tend to mark market tops, with prices peaking or plunging soon thereafter.

[Graph 6](https://i.imgur.com/l6dWpe1.png):  This takes multiple valuation measures (Shiller PE, detrended log real S&amp;P price, Tobin's Q, Buffett Indicator, and Aggregate Investor Equity Allocation for stocks; Case-Shiller HPI, FHFA All-Transactions HPI, Freddie Mac HPI, and Zillow ZHVI for housing) and graphs the z-score of them so we can compare apples to apples.

What is your opinion on using ROIC as an investment metric? In the book Valuations by Tim Koller, the author explains that a firm's valuation is driven by expected cash flows. The cash flows in turn are driven by expected returns on capital and growth. I conceptually understand this.

the higher the ROIC compared to the cost of capital, the more efficient a company is using its invested capital. Or in other words, the invested capital results in higher returns for the owners of a firm. For example, when a company invests in new equipment and it results in more efficient and cheaper production of a good (lower costs), the return on that good is higher. The capital was therefore put to good use.

What confuses me is how one measures the return on capital of a growth company in a valuation context. Let's say that a company, for example, Meta, spends huge amounts of capital on R&amp;D to build out the Metaverse. The result or potential return on this investment won't be determined until it becomes clear whether the Metaverse will be widely used and is monetizable. So ROIC can only realistically be used when the returns of a company have already come to fruition, and is, then, a metric to determine the investing effectiveness of management.

My question is how would you quantify ROIC for a fast-growing company when it is uncertain when the benefits of the investment will realistically be achieved and quantifiable.

The second element that drives expected cash flows is growth. The faster a firm grows when its ROIC &gt; WACC, the more value it creates. But this then also depends on the return of the company and becomes much harder to estimate when you're unsure about the ROIC in the long term. Growth companies continually invest in growth to create value (when the return of this growth is not obvious yet) to rapidly gain market share and then try to capture the value they create. Early-stage companies then only capture value once enough value is created through their continuous investing efforts. An example is Uber, which invested heavily in its future activities, but currently doesn't have a high return on its investments. Uber gained lots of market share, creating value for its customers, but failed to capture this value and turn profitable (due to many factors like competition, regulation, ...)

My question then again is how would you approach the valuation of growth companies when the return they get on their investments is not obvious. Aren't many growth firms valued incorrectly when some invested capital results in high returns in the short term, but lots of invested capital creates growth, but not necessary value in the long term?"|investing|The use of Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) in valuations|27.0|0.86

If the option expires, I collect the premium, get taxed on the premium at the marginal tax rate, and that's that. Similarly, if the option does get assigned and I am okay with selling the stock, that also seems pretty straightforward: I get taxed on any gains at either the long or short-term capital gains rate.

Now, let's say the option is in-the-money and I want to hold on to the stock rather than sell it. In effect, I would rather buy-to-close the option rather than sell the underlying stock. If I'm able to successfully time the buy-to-close, I think I can wrap my head around the tax implication: let's say I sell the option for a $10 premium. If I buy to close for, say, $6, that's a net of $4 gain which is taxed at the marginal rate. Or, if I buy to close for $12, that's a net $2 loss.

But where I'm finding surprisingly little information: in the event of assignment, what are the tax implications if I immediately turn around and buy back the shares at the market price? So let's say the following scenario happens:

* I buy 100 shares of stock XYZ for $50.
* Six months later, the stock rises to $60.
* I write a covered call at $65 for a $3 premium. (+$300 gain)
* The stock rises to $66 and is getting close to the expiration date.
* The option gets assigned, I sell 100 shares of XYZ at $65. (+$1500 gain)
* I immediately turn around and buy 100 shares of XYZ at $66.

Is there some ""Wash Rule-like"" factor that would take into account the fact that I re-bought the same shares? Or am I taxed on the full $1800?

I've recently come across an ETF by the Ticker XRT, the S&amp;P Retail ETF. The ETF revolves around retail businesses in the US like Victoria's Secret, Abercrombie&amp;Fitch, Gamestop, Nordstrom, Kroger, etc... They also have an equal weighting for each of their 100 components, meaning each company represents roughly 1% of the AUM. For such a dull ETF, I was amazed that over 1250% of ETF shares are currently short. I've never seen an ETF with this level of short interest so it took me down a rabbit hole to see what was going on. 

[Source on Short Interest](http://www.etfchannel.com/symbol/xrt/)

My research brought me to a recorded presentation by the Jacobs Levy Equity Center, at Wharton Upenn,  conveniently titled  [""ETF Short Interest and Failures-to-Deliver: Naked Short Selling or Operational Shorting?""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncq35zrFCAg&amp;ab_channel=JacobsLevyCenter) Where they explain that MM's take advantage of their extended settlement period (T+6 in the video) to essentially take additional short positions. Furthermore, they explain Operational shorting to not necessarily be ""Naked"" because fund managers tend to hold the underlying and wait for arbitrage opportunities to create more ETF shares and repay their net short position. 

However, at this extreme amount of shorting I am skeptical that they hold the underlying assets to pay back the shares short or create new ETF's through the underlying. Through the ETF's AUM (\~400mil) it can be deduced they hold nearly 0.1-0.2% ownership of the total shares in each of the 100 companies they invest in. Through some simple mathematics,( \~0.1 x 1250% = \~1.25 ) it can be deduced that the market is net short 1-2% of total available shares in each company, just through this ETF. To me, this seems excessive even for ""operational shorting"", as I doubt that the individuals shorting the ETF hold 1-2% of each underlying. 

So finally to my question; I'm wondering if any of the smarter individuals in this sub can say definitively that this is Naked shorting or Normal ""operational shorting"". I don't usually dabble in ETF's so this is far from my key competency and would love feedback."|investing|Question regarding ETF Short Interest|0.0|0.5

Edit:  This is a short version of the write-ups I myself write.

Alibaba - Write Up

1. **Business Model:**

Alibaba is a diversified company. Its largest segment is core commerce, which is selling products directly to consumers. In the core commerce segment, the business is very similar to Amazon. In this segment, Alibaba operates the websites Taobao, Tmall, and [Alibaba.com](https://alibaba.com/)

, among others. In addition, the not yet profitable segment, cloud computing, is experiencing strong growth. This segment has a lot of potentials and, due to the effect of the economy of scale, it is planned to make good profits in the future.

**Sector:** Consumer Cyclical **Industry:** Internet Retail

1. **Category (Peter Lynch):**

*Fast Grower:*

Alibaba is still a fast grower with an average growth of 25% per year (17,41 % revenue growth last year which is still great/fast). There will always be a moment when this growth will slow down and we take this into account in our conservative valuation. Outside of this, Alibaba is of course mainly active in China, where economic growth, and especially the growth of the middle class, is expected.

1. **Financial Position/ Profitability**

Alibaba's financial position is very strong. With a Debt/Equity ratio of only 0.65 at the time of writing, it has a very healthy balance sheet for a ""Fast Grower"". A current ratio of 1.65 which I myself find always nice to view (I use [https://www.financialstockdata.com/](https://www.financialstockdata.com/) for ratios and financials, but there are a lot of sites for this) In addition, Alibaba's net profit margins have been around 20% in recent years, and around 15% this year (due to ""Tech Chinese Crackdown""). In short, despite the government's intervention last year, still has a strong financial position and profitability, especially for a growth company.

1. **Management**

The management has recently started to buy back shares. In previous quarterly reports, it was reported that a buyback program of 15 billion is being made available. However, since 2014, shares have increased by 25%, so shareholders have been 'diluted' since the IPO. The share buyback is a big plus especially at this time as the share price is cheap at the time of writing (see valuation in point 6). Management, therefore, buys back shares cheaply, as a result of which you, as owner, get more of the company in your hands. In the long term, this yields returns.

**Moat: Competitive advantage**

Network Effects

The major competitive advantage that Alibaba has is the network effect. Suppliers and consumers (within core commerce) are both customers for BABA. Because there are a lot of customers and suppliers at BABA, customers and suppliers are quicker to choose BABA sites.

Switching Costs

Besides the network effect, Alibaba has built an ecosystem around its customers and average customer purchases have been increasing. Because of this ecosystem, it is harder for customers to switch.

1. **Intrinsic Value**

The following estimated net asset values are based on a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model, in which we assume conservative growth rates for the Free Cash Flow. Despite the conservative assumptions, we still have a large safety margin (minimum 30%). Because I can not add pictures here I explain what I have used an extra high discount rate of 13 percent for the risks and as a point to show it is undervalued. And about 14, 11, 7 percent growth rates in the good, normal and bad cases. I say about it because I use the growth rate for the first 5 years and the next 5 years after that.

**Do not forget DCF's you have a lot of freedom** in what you choose, that is why they can differ a lot and that is why I always do it conservatively, it gives you an idea what you should pay for a company or when it is a bit too much and that is great. But the number is not exact. You can see it more as eyeballing.

The 2020 crash gave me opportunity to go in big with all my savings, basically i went from 40k to 70k (growth stocks plus wheeling cc/csp), then BAAM down about 20k from Nov and Dec, profolio is back to ~52k i called it quit early Jan, all cash since, bad decision or not it saved me some money from the nastier fall in late Jan.

I cannot take anymore risk, for my mental health mostly, i got absolutely sick with sleepless nights and not getting any work done. Zero trust in this market, but cant let inflation eats up the 50k.

Imma keep 10k emergency, the rest is going dividends (safer than index etfs, i hope?). Im looking at:

Jepi 25%
Nusi 25%
Divo 25%
Qyld 8%
Xyld 8%
O 8%

I dont care about gains growth or income really, just trying to fight inflation right now, i got another 10k in i-bonds, and just 10k in Low yield saving for emergency.

This was picked up on Twitter and the markets started to freak out. I’ve outlined what happened in the following timeline – note all times are in EST

## 1:47 PM – AFRM “accidentally” tweets out earnings results and then deletes the tweet.

There were a few accounts on twitter that caught this mistake and started to share it – one of the larger accounts being Stock Market News – [here is a link to the tweet](https://twitter.com/ArkkDaily/status/1491846317336846338). Leading up to this time it was relatively quiet across social media as people were waiting for the earnings after market close. At this point in time AFRM was trading at about $80 per share and started to become more volatile based on the tweet starting to be shared across Twitter.

*“$AFRM when you write the perfect scheduled tweet and accidentally just send it 💀”*

To give you a bit of perspective of how significant this mistake was, here is a breakdown of how quickly it started to circulate across twitter for the next 30 minutes

Number of tweets increased 580%, number of likes increased 211% and number of impressions (how many people see a tweet mentioning AFRM) increase a whopping 842%. 32 million people saw a tweet related to AFRM in this short span of time. This will all picked up on the [Utradea Social Sentiment Dashboard](https://utradea.com/social-dashboard)  


For the next little while there seems to be a mix of Calls and Puts being purchased, and the flow looked a bit more active. The price moves between $82 and $77 per share. The market was still trying to make sense of the accidental tweet

## 2:45 PM – AFRM Share Price Starts to drop of the cliff

Around this time AFRM is trading $82 per share, and then a few minutes later we see it nosedive to $51 per share in a mater of minutes. Trading was halted for a few minutes over this time period, but the stock continued to fall. Once trading resumed, we started to see the price bounce back up as high as $65 a share.

At this point the damage was done. The tweet wiped out close to 25% of the share price and approximately $5 Billon in market cap.

## 3:20 PM – AFRM tweets out actual earnings release

Here is a quote of their tweet “Due to human error, a small portion of Affirm’s fiscal Q2 results were inadvertently tweeted from Affirm’s official Twitter account earlier today.”

Below I’ve highlighted a few bullets from their official earnings release.

Second Quarter of Fiscal Year 2022 Operating Highlights:

* *Gross merchandise volume (""GMV"") for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 was $4.5 billion, an increase of 115%. Excluding the impact from the completion of the initial rollout of Affirm's interest-bearing solution with Amazon in November, GMV doubled.*
* *Active merchants increased from 8,000 to 168,000, driven primarily by the adoption of Shop Pay Installments by merchants on Shopify's platform.*
* *Active consumers grew 150% to 11.2 million and increased by 2.5 million, or 29%, compared to the period ended September 30, 2021.*
* *Transactions per active consumer increased 15% to 2.5 as of December 31, 2021.*

Looking at these results you’d be happy as an AFRM investor – they performed extremely well in the last quarter.  


Unfortunately, the damage is done – at market close the shares were trading at $60. Here are some of the tweets in response to AFRM earnings blunder

*“I expect to be fully compensated. I’ve contacted your IR team. This is not acceptable”*

*“Wtf. Lost over 50k because of this mistake. Entire plan was to expect earnings after hours not during”*

*“This “human error” cost me a ton of money.  Good earnings overall but this screw up cost me big.  Stock dropped and was manipulated down.  Options flow was super bullish on this.”*

### Closing Thoughts on AFRM Earnings Blunder

First, the power of social media in the stock market, especially Twitter. Whether it as an accident or not, Affirm dropping this news on Twitter will get picked up almost instantly. Even if it is deleted. Twitter is truly one of the best sources for real-time stock market information. AFRM would be more than aware of this. As an investor, you should have an active pulse on what is trending on Twitter.

Secondly, I think we will see an investigation into what happened with the early tweet. It could have been an honest mistake, but you can look at put options that were purchased ahead of time an see who stood to gain from a significant drop in price. I will be watching this closely over the next little while."|investing|Affirm Earnings Blunder - AFRM “Accidentally” Releases Earnings 2 Hrs Early with a Tweet|244.0|0.94
1644522572.0|0.0|t3_spf9xr|8.0|"Opened a managed brokerage account with a namebrand brokerage last March. We discussed general risk aversion, time horizons, and what the money was intended for. Simply, it's the ""extra cash"" we have left over after making all the rounds into our retirement accounts, education funds, etc. And there is no specific purpose for it other than general wealth accumulation. The manager set it at moderately aggressive, which put it in the pretty standard 65/35 asset allocation (40% US stocks, 25% international stocks, 35% Bond ETFs). Note, the managed account comes with a 1% annual management fee (0.25% account value gets taken out every QTR).

After letting the year play out and learning more, I'm on the verge of removing the management oversight to the account. That 1% fee being the biggest reason. It seems it's just a boiler-plate portfolio of about 15 different positions (all various ETFs) that I can simplify and boil down to just 3 or 4 common ETFs, and go at it on my own. And there was zero movement on the positions from the manager all year long.... which, to me, is not worth paying the 1% fee on. I have a recurring monthly payment to the account, which it would then automatically disperse those funds across the various positions. Which is nice, but not worth losing 1% off the top just to have an auto purchase function.

So, my goal is to remove the management status on the account and change it to a ""self-directed"" brokerage account. I'll keep the current positions as is, but I'll probably sell all the positions at the 1-year mark (very soon) to avoid any short term capital gains hits, and just reinvest everything into a much simpler 3-4 ETF portfolio that maintains a similar 65/35 asset allocation structure. It's around 6 figures, so it'll be the biggest amount I've ever seen/managed on my own, but I honestly couldn't justify paying this broker a 1% management fee and have 15 positions open, in what I feel I can do with 3-4 ETFs.

Anyone else walk away from managed accounts and just ""dumbed it down"" using 3-4 ETFs?

Extra:

I will probably go with iShares ETFs, since this is what makes up the core structure of the account anyways.

In January, I called Fidelity and said I want to liquidate those and move the money to my Brokeragelink Acct.  They said no problem.  Called them back the next day, they said the trade went through, money will be in Brokeragelink in 3-5 business days.


Money never showed up in BL.  So after several phone calls, they tell me ""Hey here's why the money isn't there - there was an issue with the trade, the order never went through, and you still have the shares. What do you want to do?""  At this point I decided to hold the shares rather than liquidate them, and asked Fidelity to change the dividend re-investment plan for those shares, and leave them in my 401k.  They said ok, will do.


FFWD to today. I log in to my 401k, and I see that I have the cash amount from those shares in my Brokerage link, so it looks like at some point those shares DID sell. I'm about to call them and see what's up, but...  Is this something that has happened to anyone else?  In the perfect world I'd rather have the shares still, but that ship may have sailed.  I'm not really sure what I'm asking here, I""m just shocked this happened, because my last conversation was that ""The shares never sold; you still have them, we're gonna change the reinvestment strategy.""  WTF happened!?



EDIT: I talked to Fidelity, and they are bewildered.  They said the that the shares sold on Jan 10 on ""the back end,"" and that as of Jan 19, neither my representative nor her supervisor were able to see that the shares sold. In fact, they confirmed the shares had NOT sold.  They asked if I would be interested in a ""trade reversal,"" that would ""reset"" this, and make it as though the sale had never happened. I had no idea that was possible; I said yes, they said they have a team checking into it. 


I asked what other options were, they said they had no idea. I asked what happened next, they said ""We don't know. This is a one-off I've never seen before. Wait 5 to 10 business days and we'll get back to you""

You’ll also be able to differentiate which posts/comments are credible.

It’s okay to pass a tip along but be as cautious as you can before pressing buy or sell.

Some investors are making buying suggestions in bearish markets and vise versa.

I recently have seen a lot of finance ""influencers"", as you would call it, and YouTubers attempting to time the market. It seems reasonable to do so, especially when the market has been wiggly and volatile in the past couple of months. 

But this quote from Peter Lynch is a fantastic reminder of why timing the market is obsolete. Human emotions are imperfect and trying to time the market is no better than a fool's errand. The better thing to do is to simply invest in businesses that you understand at a good price, and continue to DCA through the downturns. 

Making rash decisions such as choosing to sell everything based upon some hunch that you have is probably going to get you nowhere.

I often read investment and stocks subreddits in addiction to my usual economic and financial research. One thing really stands out. Panic selling is always because people give too many fucks about what their investments are doing. The first step is to figure out how long you are investing this money for or what is it you are saving for. When will you need it? Do you care if it does much more than beat inflation? 


You could read about all the best ways of investing but this isn't about that. The point is that if you know what you are doing and where you want to be going then any temporary setbacks should be as relevant as a bug on your windshield. It happens. The bug is gone and it probably had a short lifespan anyway. You flip your wipers and forget about it. The same goes for investments and savings. Sometimes you can't save as much as you set out to or an emergency happens and you need to spend some savings. The actual flow of money over a span of time should be towards securing yourself and any family you have. Panic and stress over the short term that doesn't impact you is a waste of your time.

It seems that a lot of is based on the assumption that markets tend to go up, But zooming out it seems to be that a lot of this investment advice is based on recency bias. In fact [adjusting](https://www.macrotrends.net/2324/sp-500-historical-chart-data) to inflation and viewed on a log scale paints a totally different picture. It seems that an unlucky investor putting their money into the 500 largest and most profitable companies at the height of the market in 1929 wouldn’t have definitively been “in the clear” all the way until 1985. It very much looks like all those gains retroactively applied to a 100-year theoretical sp500 only look good on average, but in reality you have a 60 year period with zero to no growth and then 40 year period of insane growth, which averages out to a decent 100 year growth. Going forward, it might signal to a potential investor that index fund in fact is not the best investment since a 60 year period is basically one’s lifetime and it might be your children and grandchildren who finally enjoy some profits, and that maybe dividend investing might be a much safer bet. It might also signal the past 40 years are an anomaly and normally markets don’t just always go up. Any thoughts?

Edit: since a lot of people are picking on the fact that I chose the height of the marker before the Great Depression, I’ll clarify (which I thought was obvious just by looking at the graph), that this period is not unique.

Zoom out to a year on QQQ and the shape is quite apparent, and in a more attenuated form in SPX and the total market as well. 

There's the usual chatter as to the forces currently at work from both analysts and market participants, including here. I must say that as a non-expert retail investor who reads regularly, it definitely seems that sentiment, at least, has changed; the permabull stuff is dying away. 

Thoughts? The head-and-shoulders pattern is thought to be one of the most reliable technical indicators. We have a lot of attempts to rally in meme stocks like TSLA, but they seem to be losing ground. 

A related but important question is, if we are to see the second shoulder, what comes after? So far the Fed's interference, er, guiding hand has largely softened and protracted what would otherwise have been sharper corrections for a clearly overextended market. So far we haven't seen margin calls and other accelerants on a large scale. The fact we haven't reached that tipping point doesn't mean it's impossible or unlikely, but it's hard to assess.

**ETA: For those who like to baselessly claim widespread debunking of TA or that there's no evidence for the head-and-shoulders pattern, you are simply incorrect--please contribute to the discussion but without simple conclusive dismissals.** For example, see:

[**The Predictive Power of “Head-and-Shoulders ” Price Patterns in the U.S. Stock Market**](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/31474225_The_Predictive_Power_of_Head-and-Shoulders_Price_Patterns_in_the_US_Stock_Market_Gene_Savin)

&gt; **Risk-adjusted excess returns to a trading strategy conditioned on “head-and-shoulders” price patterns are 5–7% per year. Combining the strategy with the market portfolio produces a significant increase in excess return** for a fixed level of risk exposure.

While at the branch I was invited to revisit and go over my plan and help to decide if I want it managed or not. I have the choice of a robot-advisory or managing it myself. But I have a slightly complicated situation that could sway the choice o let me run it by you. 

#1 it’s an inherited IRA and I need to draw it down over the next 10 years, I’m planning on taking 20% out this year for debt and family issues, leaving me ~250k. I’m 20 years old so I plan on going to college and I currently have unstable work as a car detailer; moral of the story I plan on taking out more to help pay for these things. Why am I telling you this? Because I know the common perception that “SCHWAB ROBO KEEPS TO MUCH CASH” like 6-12%.

Idea💡-Maybe the extra cash can be used to draw down the account without touching the principal investments.

#2 The robot route might be dumb because I will cause me to liquidate all my positions, I learned today that the account is 99% equity’s 1% cash and contains shares of Amazon, Apple, and Adobe. Probably more big ones too. It’s about 57 individual positions. I’m afraid that some of these positions are good and I would want to let them ride rather than put them into a robo fund at Schwab.

Idea 💡- I could not robo-advise and liquidate the positions I don’t like or don’t fully understand and use that cash to draw down while I assemble a more “bogle head” portfolio more focused on index funds and ETF’s.

Note: This portfolio was assembled by fisher investments.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation seized computers from the home of prominent short seller Andrew Left, the founder of Citron Research, in early 2021, some of the people said. In more recent months, the Justice Department subpoenaed certain market participants seeking communications, calendars and other records relating to almost 30 investment and research firms, as well as three dozen individuals associated with them, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing confidential inquiries.

Many on that roster -- a veritable who’s-who of the activist short-selling realm -- said they haven’t been contacted directly by the government, leaving some exasperated about being left in the dark. Reached for comment, Left also said he’s frustrated.

“It’s very tough to defend yourself when you haven’t been accused of anything,” Left said. “I’m cooperating and I have full faith in the system and the First Amendment,” he added, referencing protections on free speech.

The long list of names underscores the breadth of the Justice Department investigation first described by Bloomberg in December and shows how authorities are trying to map out alliances and understand how short sellers handle research and arrange bets that stocks will fall. It remains unclear which, if any, of the names mentioned in subpoenas might be targets of the inquiry or merely have ties to other people or entities of interest.

The Securities and Exchange Commission also has sent some requests for information, people with knowledge of those inquiries said. Spokespeople for the Justice Department and SEC declined to comment. No one has been accused of wrongdoing, and in many cases, the opening of a probe doesn’t lead to anyone facing charges.

Prominent firms and their leaders mentioned in the Justice Department’s requests to some market participants include Melvin Capital Management and founder Gabe Plotkin; Orso Partners and Nate Koppikar; Sophos Capital Management and Jim Carruthers; as well as Kerrisdale Capital Management. The list also includes well-known researchers such as Nate Andersonand his Hindenburg Research, as well as Fraser Perring and his Viceroy Research.

One area of focus is how investors set up their bets that stocks will decline. Investigators have been looking, for example, for signs that money managers might try to engineer startling stock drops to induce selling by market makers or other investors, or engage in other abuses, such as insider trading, people familiar with the matter have said."|investing|Vast DOJ Probe Looks at Almost 30 Short-Selling Firms and Allies|1067.0|0.96

Game engine maker Unity reported earnings and revenues that beat Wall Street’s expectations for the fourth quarter ended December 31.

The company’s stock rose 16% in after-hours trading to $106.30 a share, up 14%. The company’s closing market valuation was $27 billion.

The San Francisco-based company also forecast better-than-expected earnings for the year ahead.

In Q4, Unity lost an adjusted 5 cents a share on sales of $315.9 million. Analysts had expected Unity to lose 7 cents a share on sales of $295.5 million. In the year-earlier period, it lost 10 cents a share on sales of $220.3 million.

For the current quarter, Unity forecast sales of $317.5 million, up 35% from the same period last year and matching Wall Street’s target. That’s based on the midpoint of its outlook.

“We closed out the quarter with great momentum,” said John Riccitiello, CEO of Unity, in a call with analysts.

Snap reported its first quarterly net profit on Thursday, and beat analyst estimates for the fourth quarter on earnings, revenue and user growth.

The report comes a day after Facebook parent Meta delivered disappointing guidance for the first quarter that dragged down several social media stocks with it. Snap fell 23.6% Thursday prior to its own earnings announcement but popped as much as 62% after hours, before settling up about 52%.

Here are the key numbers:

Earnings per share: 22 cents, adjusted vs 10 cents expected, according to a Refinitiv survey of analystsRevenue: $1.3 billion vs $1.2 billion, according to RefinitvGlobal Daily Active Daily Users (DAUs): 319 million vs 316.9 million, according to StreetAccountAverage Revenue per User (ARPU): $4.06 vs $3.79, according to StreetAccount

It also provided a Q1 guidance range of $1.03 billion to $1.08 billion, higher than the $1.01 billion analysts anticipated, according to Refinitiv. It expects daily active users between 328 million and 330 million in the first quarter, beating analyst estimates of 327.8 million, according to StreetAccount.

Snap has to contend with similar headwinds as Meta, which warned that it anticipates a $10 billion revenue hit in 2022 resulting from Apple’s privacy changes on iOS that make it harder to target consumers with advertiser content.

Snap also distributes its app on Apple iPhones and serves advertising content to monetize its business. But Snap’s direct response advertising businesses experienced a recovery from the iOS changes “quicker than we anticipated,” according to prepared remarks for CFO Derek Anderson for the company’s analyst call.

During the Q&amp;A period, Andersen said that Snap has been mindful to make privacy inherent to its products and as a result, the changes caused by the iOS changes are “likely to be experienced differently for our business than perhaps for others.”

Still, Anderson said in his opening comments that Snap still thinks “it will take at least a couple more quarters for our advertising partners to build full confidence in our new measurement solutions.”

Chief Business Officer Jeremi Gorman said in her prepared remarks that the sales team is helping advertisers transition through the changes. Gorman said advertisers who tend to focus on “lower funnel goals” like in-app purchases have been most impacted and some have migrated to “mid-funnel goals” like installs or clicks, where there’s greater visibility despite the iOS changes.

Andersen also pointed to macroeconomic forces like supply chain disruptions and labor challenges impacting advertisers and impacting Snap’s brand advertising sector, specifically."|investing|Snap shares rocket as much as 62% on first-ever quarterly net profit|131.0|0.93

$AMZN is currently up 18% in AH.

Amazon (AMZN) reported fourth quarter results on Thursday and announced it will raise its Prime membership fee to $139 per year from $119 in the U.S. The stock is soaring in after-hours.

These are the top- and bottom-line results for Amazon's fourth quarter.

Earnings per share: $27.75

Revenue: $137.4 billion

This is the third time since the launch of Amazon Prime that the e-commerce giant raises prices for its yearly delivery service in the U.S. It hiked fees in 2014 and 2018 by $20 each time. The announced price change will go into effect for new members on February 18th. Existing members will see the fees upon their renewal date after March 25.

The company's net income nearly doubled last quarter compared to the same period the previous year, in large part because of the company's investment in EV startup Rivian (RIVN). Amazon reported $14.3 billion in net income for Q4, compared to $7.2 billion during the last three months of 2020.

""Fourth quarter 2021 net income includes a pre-tax valuation gain of $11.8 billion included in non-operating income from our common stock investment in Rivian Automotive, Inc., which completed an initial public offering in November,"" said the company's earnings statement.

Net sales increased 9% to $137.4 billion in the fourth quarter, compared with $125.6 billion in the same period last year.

Amazon's Web Services unit brought in $17.78 billion in revenue for the quarter, compared to expectations of $17.23 billion.

The company's 1st quarter revenue forecast is for $112 billion-$117 billion. The Street was expecting guidance of $120 billion.

“As expected over the holidays, we saw higher costs driven by labor supply shortages and inflationary pressures, and these issues persisted into the first quarter due to Omicron. Despite these short-term challenges, we continue to feel optimistic and excited about the business as we emerge from the pandemic,"" ""Andy Jassy, Amazon CEO said in the company's earnings release.

&gt;Don’t count on the central bank intervening over market volatility  
&gt;  
&gt;If market volatility occurs in a vacuum, it is not the Fed’s job to contain it, unless it actually threatens the stability of the financial system  
&gt;  
&gt;**Don’t fight the Fed.** The saying was popularised by the late Marty Zweig, this author’s first boss and mentor on Wall Street in the 1980s and 1990s. Zweig also coined the phrase: “Don’t fight the tape”.  
&gt;  
&gt;The tape — the record of stocks transactions through the day — is decidedly not fighting the US Federal Reserve, with the prospect of monetary policy normalisation clearly behind a very rocky start to the year for US shares. It is typically a pothole-riddled path that is created when central banks begin to normalise policy — even more so during this anything-but-normal pandemicycle (there’s a new word for you).  
&gt;  
&gt;Conceding that inflation is not quite a transitory phenomenon, the Fed is now on a mission. The launch point for the Covid-19 tightening cycle is unusual, in part due to what appears to be a much later phase in the cycle for the economy than the calendar might suggest. The post-2020 recession expansion is only 21 months new but the inflation, labour market and asset valuation backdrop is decidedly later-cycle.  
&gt;  
&gt;Much recent analysis of past tightening cycles have been limited to just the prior three rounds of Fed rate rises, but those only date back to 1999 — an era characterised by secular disinflation and the attendant positive correlation between bond yields and stock prices. It is different this time.  
&gt;  
&gt;The inflation cat is out of the bag; and arguably, the Fed opened the bag on purpose when, in August 2020, it implemented a more flexible monetary policy strategy. In, short, the Fed has been actively pursuing higher inflation. The aim is to let inflation run hot to compensate for the lengthy era of disinflation.  
&gt;  
&gt;Another key difference between the current path towards policy normalisation and past episodes is the Fed’s $9tn balance sheet. Markets are perhaps keenly aware of the perceived implications of its quantitative easing programme of bond buying on yields and asset prices; but they have much less experience with pending quantitative tightening.  
&gt;  
&gt;The plumbing system that connects QE (or QT) to asset prices is indirect and complex. But the psychological system connecting them tends to be more direct. Signals from the Fed about balance sheet plans have been important market drivers — highlighting the power of the Fed’s words, aka jawboning.  
&gt;  
&gt;Fed officials are now explicitly stating their desire for tighter financial conditions in the interest of moving away from hyper-stimulative policies, squeezing aggregate demand and bringing inflation down. No, imminent rate rises do nothing to solve the semiconductor backlog problem, nor do they bring down the number of container ships sitting off the ports of Long Beach. However, coupled with the Fed’s jawboning, they can arguably change the trajectory of inflation expectations and/or aggregate demand via consumers’ behaviour.  
&gt;  
&gt;The hope is that both the economy and financial markets can adjust to monetary policy normalisation in an orderly fashion. But here is where things might get tricky. The notion of a “Fed put” has been in and out of play since the Alan Greenspan era; with many market participants believing the central bank will step in if markets begin to riot. Do not count on that in this era.  
&gt;  
&gt;For now, financial markets are volatile, but functioning properly. The volatility and weakness are occurring alongside the repricing of risk assets — not being driven by any serious deterioration in liquidity conditions or financial system functionality. In fact, the equity market is a component of most indices measuring financial conditions. As such, equity market volatility-induced tightening of financial conditions could arguably be a feature, not a bug, as it relates to prospective Fed decisions.  
&gt;  
&gt;Back in 2018, Fed chair Jay Powell spoke about the crucial difference between financial market volatility and financial system instability. They are not one and the same.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Fed’s job is to try to bring about policies — and often create new tools — to ease instability in the financial system. There are times that market volatility can lead to financial system instability. However, if market volatility occurs in a vacuum, it is not the Fed’s job to contain it — unless it actually threatens the stability of the financial system.  
&gt;  
&gt;This year’s increased volatility and correction in stocks is indicative of a less friendly monetary policy. For all the benefits having accrued to the economy and investors’ portfolios of asset appreciation, the Fed is keenly aware that it is time to begin reining in some of the excess liquidity. Absent the renewal of the Fed put, not fighting the Fed remains the market’s modus operandi."|investing|Has the Fed ‘put’ been put to bed?|21.0|0.87

Starbucks is facing a fast-growing union campaign just weeks after the first U.S. corporate store unionized in Buffalo, N.Y.

Employees at 54 stores in 19 states are pursuing union elections, according to organizers. Fifteen of those stores joined the union drive on Monday, petitioning the federal labor officials to set a vote. The filing coincides with the start of contract negotiations between Starbucks and unionized workers in Buffalo.

Last month, Starbucks workers at three New York stores held union elections. A majority voted in favor at two of the three locations, unionizing 64 workers. Now, some 30 Starbucks workers in Mesa, Ariz., are wrapping up their own union election by mail. Employees at three more Buffalo-area locations also begin voting this week. Starbucks workers form their 1st union in the U.S. in a big win for labor.

Altogether, the union-election push affects only a fraction of almost 9,000 U.S. stores run by Starbucks. But the quick and high-profile first union victory in Buffalo became a watershed moment for the company, especially as restaurant workers are among the country's least unionized."|investing|Starbucks ($SBUX) union push spreads to 54 stores in 19 states|278.0|0.89

Feb 2 (Reuters) - Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc (FB.O) shares plunged 20% late on Wednesday as the social media company missed on Wall Street earnings estimates and posted a weaker-than-expected forecast.

Meta said it faced hits from Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) privacy changes to its operating system, which have made it harder for brands to target and measure their ads on Facebook and Instagram, and from macroeconomic issues like supply-chain disruptions. read more

The after-hours slump in Meta shares vaporized $200 billion worth of its market value, with another $15 billion in value lost from peers Twitter Inc (TWTR.N), Snap Inc (SNAP.N) and Pinterest Inc (PINS.N).

Shares of Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), which posted record quarterly sales that topped expectations on Tuesday, were down 1.3%. read more

Meta, which has the second-largest digital ad platform in the world after Google, had previously warned its advertising business faced ""significant uncertainty"" in the fourth quarter. read more

The company forecast first-quarter revenue in the range of $27 billion to $29 billion. Analysts were expecting $30.15 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Apple's changes to its operating software give users the preference to allow tracking of their activity online, making it harder for advertisers who rely on data to develop new products and know their market.

The company's total revenue, the bulk of which comes from ad sales, rose to $33.67 billion in the fourth quarter from $28.07 billion a year earlier, beating analysts' estimates of $33.40 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Net loss from Meta's Reality Labs, the company's augmented and virtual reality business, was $10.2 billion for the full year 2021, compared with a $6.6 billion loss the previous year. It was the first time the company had broken out this segment in its results.

CEO Mark Zuckerberg had previously warned that the company's investment in this area would reduce 2021 operating profit by $10 billion and would not be profitable ""any time in the near future.""

The company said on Wednesday it would this year change its stock ticker to ""META,"" the latest step in its rebrand to focus on the metaverse, a futuristic idea of virtual environments where users can work, socialize and play.

The tech giant, which changed its name in October to reflect its metaverse aims, is betting the metaverse will be the successor to the mobile internet. It did not comment on the price of a deal with Roundhill Investments, which said in January it would stop using the symbol for its Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF.

Meta's rebrand comes at a time of increasing scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators over allegations of anticompetitive conduct and over the impacts of how it handles harmful or misleading content across its Facebook and Instagram platforms. read more

I just became eligible for a SARSEP retirement account at my company. No one offers these anymore.  I was grandfathered in through my company. The account is at Wells Fargo.  


I got the first monthly contribution in my account. I couldn't see a way to place orders online. So I called our company's advisor. He said that we have to place orders through him and that Wells Fargo charges a $7 fee each time. He said there is no way for us to invest our funds without him or another advisor. There is no way to do it online and no way to set up an automatic purchase.   


$7 every month seems cost prohibitive. Any gains in asset value would get eaten up by this fee. It sounds like the only way around is to place one order at the end of the year. Meanwhile the cash is just sitting there getting eaten by inflation and missing out on any potential gains. This seems like a really shitty deal. It seems like it would be better if I just put my contributions in my regular ROTH IRA.

&amp;#x200B;

Table of contents:

1) First, what are the risks; Quick Notes

2) Master equation

	a) gaap earnings per EV

		i) model &amp; explanation

		ii) dropping battery costs

		iii) increase in efficiency of manufacturing/innovation

		iv) regulator credits will vanish. Tesla is insanely profitable without them.

	b) EVs delivered

		i) why competition won't affect Tesla's sales

	c) P/E ratio

		i) reasons and justification for a 50 P/E

&amp;#x200B;

1) I'll start with the risks to my valuation model: 

In my opinion, the biggest risk to Tesla is failing to execute on the growth plan. The biggest hindrance I can see for Tesla's valuation will be failing to achieve their 50% YoY growth targets.

If there's an actual economic recession where consumers have to drastically cut back spending, then Tesla would definitely suffer. But this risk is obvious, and probably applies to 99% of growth stocks. Side note: Tesla currently makes such good margin on their EVs, that they have the flexibility of dropping prices to meet demand; however, this would greatly cut into earnings and reinvesting into growth. 

And of course there's the silly, but still very valid, risk to the valuation of companies that the market takes an irrational dive of 20%+, and investors lose confidence in stocks for the foreseeable future. However, Tesla's growth target might still be attainable in this economic environment.

I do \*NOT\* see new EVs from other companies entering the market as a risk to Tesla. There are 80M auto sales globally every year. My model calculates that Tesla obtains 12.1M of the sales (in 2027). This leaves plenty of room for legacy automakers and new EV manufacturers to sell millions of their own EVs.

Quick Note: This model is based \*only\* on EV sales. This does not include solar and energy storage, AI, robotics, or FSD. I see 2027 as the peak year of profitability for Tesla EV sales (we'll see why in my model in section 2ai)

Another Note: My model below has a base case (based on 50% YoY growth as Tesla aims for), a bear case (based on 40% YoY growth), and a bull case (based on 60% YoY growth) i.e. in the event that Tesla fails to execute on 50% YoY growth, achieving only 40%, then the bear case shows how the numbers could be affected

&amp;#x200B;

2) I'd like to start with a simple equation, and expand on the details of the equation. This is for year 2027:

$12,000 gaap earnings per EV \* 12,100,000 EVs delivered \* 50 P/E = $7.2T market cap or approximately $7000/share

Sections 2a, 2b and 2c will be the reasoning behind $12k gaap earnings per ev, 12.1M EVs delivered, and 50 P/E respectively

2a) This gaap earnings per EV metric will be the most difficult to explain. I'll start with my model and an explanation

2ai) Here's my model: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12\_Qp2gXP1HV3EC5UOWBytx6Kn5dfNftqkTo0EwP0Ua8/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12_Qp2gXP1HV3EC5UOWBytx6Kn5dfNftqkTo0EwP0Ua8/edit?usp=sharing)

Note: non-gaap earnings per EV through 2021 by quarter: $5628, $8060, $8622, $9208

Explanation of model: Warning, this is incredibly detailed. I'm going to try to keep the explanation as simple as possible, and I'm more than happy to answer any questions. 

Note: I wrote this DD before Q4 earnings came out, and I decided to leave that data point so you can actually see that my prediction was $2.48 non-GAAP earnings (not bad, huh? actual was $2.54)

The black numbers are known numbers (from 2020 Q3 to 2021 Q3). The red numbers are unknown, but projected numbers. From known numbers in the ER reports I was able to calculate ASP (average selling price, i.e. total auto revenue/evs delivered), COG per EV (cost of goods per EV, i.e. ASP\*(1- gross margin)), earnings per EV ((non-GAAP EPS\*outstanding shares)/EV delivered), and I was also able to calculate a sort of ""operational/manufacturing cost per EV"" by this equation:

ASP - COG per EV - earnings per EV = ""operational"" cost per EV

Here's a beautiful illustration of this equation:

[https://imgur.com/a/9vJcx0u](https://imgur.com/a/9vJcx0u)

So now that we have ASP, COG per EV, earnings per EV, an ""operational"" cost per EV and EVs delievered.. how do I project to get the red numbers? I extrapolated using exponential decay. Based on the rates that ASP, COG per EV and ""operational"" cost per EV were already falling, I took that rate and extrapolated out using an exponential decay model. I also assumed 50% YoY growth in EVs delievred (or 10.66% QoQ compounding). 

The math for exponential decay was pretty annoying. For anyone interseted, here's the recursive equation: P1 = (P0 - b)\*(1 - r) + b where P1 is one iteration past P0, b is the asymptote and r is the rate of decay. Solving for r gives r = 1-(P1-b)/(P0-b), and so I calculated the average r from the past 4 or 5 iterations to ""use"" the existing rate of decay. Interesting fact, I had to assume some 'asymptotes' for ASP, COG per EV and operational cost per EV, but if you look at my bear, base and bull cases where I've modified them, you'll see a very little difference in the outlook. The main difference between the base, bull and bear cases is simply growth of sales.

So now that I've extrapolated ASP, COG per EV, ""operational"" cost per EV and EVs delivered.. I can now calculate the project non-GAAP earnings per EV via the equation I used above: 

earnings per EV = ASP - COG per EV - ""operational"" cost per EV

this one: [https://imgur.com/a/9vJcx0u](https://imgur.com/a/9vJcx0u)

After finding earnings per EV, divide by the projected EVs delivered, and then by outstanding shares and you have the non-GAAP EPS estimates.

Now for some interesting (but not very pretty) graphs. Again, take 2029 and 2030 with a grain of salt. The S-curve will flatten

&amp;#x200B;

This is my favorite graph. Through no design of my own, but only from exponential decay extrapolations of other metrics, the non-GAAP earnings per EV graph tops out in 2027 as the year we'll see peak profitability per EV.

&amp;#x200B;

ok, so why do we see dropping ASP, COG and operational costs?

2aii) Dropping battery costs can be summed up with Wright's Law (Cathie Wood was one of the early TSLA investors that spoke of Wright's Law). Battery costs were as high as $1000/kWh\*\* when Tesla first started building the original Roadster. It has since dropped to $100/kWh, and is expected to drop to $50 or less per kWh.

\*\*reference to $1000/kWh: J.B. Straubel, former CTO of Tesla, interview: [https://youtu.be/aWR5-mo8f1g?t=1520](https://youtu.be/aWR5-mo8f1g?t=1520)

Here is an excellent reference to declining battery costs as presented by Tony Seba. This presentation was centered around upcoming innovative and disruptive technologies: [https://youtu.be/Kj96nxtHdTU?t=405](https://youtu.be/Kj96nxtHdTU?t=405)

&amp;#x200B;

2aiii) ""Tesla isn't profitable!"" we heard for years. This is because they were burning cash for R&amp;D. They've made their manufacturing more efficient with innovations like the structural battery pack and gigacasting, and with 2 new factories we'll see even more benefits from Economies of Scale\*\*\*. Also, as Tesla opens Austin to serve the east coast US, and Berlin to serve Europe we'll see decreased shipping costs. This will cause the ""operational/manufacturing"" cost per EV to drop.

\*\*\*[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economiesofscale.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economiesofscale.asp)

&amp;#x200B;

2aiv) regulatory credits were 13% of earnings in 2021 Q3, and 11% of earnings in 2021 Q4. But I'm not sure I need to make a bull case for collecting free money.

&amp;#x200B;

2b) Will Tesla deliver 12M EVs in 2027? This is a fundamental risk for my model, as stated above. If Tesla maintains their 50% YoY sales growth, then they will sell 12M in 2027. We'll see. However, one thing for certain will not change Tesla sales:

&amp;#x200B;

2bi) Competition. Tesla has \*always\* had competition. They had competition in 2013 to their Model S, and they have competition today. It's the ICE car, and Tesla is still managing to sell every EV they make. A couple points to make here:

I wont get into this point too much. It took Tesla 5 years from their first mass produced EV until they managed positive Free Cash Flow (2013 Model S until 2018). It's not exactly a one-to-one comparison for other companies, but Ford, GM, Rivian, Lucid and others will need at least a couple years to achieve positive free cash flow on the EV segment of their business. But let's say all of them succeed in making a nice commercially viable, and profitable EV..

My next point is that the EV market is expanding \*rapidly\*. New EV models will not likely take sales from Tesla. They will take sales from the Toyota Corolla, RAV4, Camry, Honda Civic, Accord, Hyundai cars, Volkwagen cars, etc. as we've already witnessed. There's no reason to believe that any new EVs entering the market will take meaningful sales from other EVs instead of gas cars.

&amp;#x200B;

2c) The P/E ratio will always be a guess. Tesla will be a company with a presence in EV sales, solar and energy storage, large commercial power storage, and potentially FSD software subscriptions and AI driven bots. I believe (assuming a bull market) that there will still be enough frenzy surrounding Tesla to see a 100 P/E in 2027. The conservative side of me calculates these numbers with 50. By the time the S-Curve flattens, the P/E could be 30.. or maybe 60 like Amazon? It's hard to say where Tesla will be in 2030, but they've always innovated and come up with new ideas.

&amp;#x200B;

There is one thing I confident about though; Tesla should \*never\* be trading at Toyota, Ford, or GM's P/E ratios. The ICE car is a dead technology, not dropping in price like the EV, and is proving to be far inferior to EVs in every way. Plus legacy automakers are not growing (some have \*lost\* sales for the last 2 years). It took Tesla investing billions over a decade to bring down battery costs, and make the EV commercially viable. Something legacay automakers have never done.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I hope you guys liked this DD. I'll try to have discussion with you guys in the comments if you'd like. If you have a bearish counterpoint, then I'm all about discussing it; however, it will help me (and both of us) if you point out which part of this equation it affects:

$12,000 gaap earnings per EV \* 12,100,000 EVs delivered \* 50 P/E = $7260/share

so that we can establish the point of disagreement.

[https://www.fidelitydigitalassets.com/articles/bitcoin-first](https://www.fidelitydigitalassets.com/articles/bitcoin-first)

Once investors have decided to invest in digital assets, the next question becomes, ""Which one?"" Of course, bitcoin is the most  recognized, first-ever digital asset, but there are hundreds and even  thousands of other digital assets in the ecosystem.

One of the first concerns investors have regarding bitcoin is as the  first digital asset it may be vulnerable to innovative destruction from  competitors (such as the story of MySpace and Facebook). Another common  consideration surrounding bitcoin is whether it offers the same  potential reward or upside as some of the newer and smaller digital  assets that have emerged.

In this paper we propose:

* Bitcoin is best understood as a monetary good, and one of the  primary investment theses for bitcoin is as the store of value asset in  an increasingly digital world.


* Bitcoin is fundamentally different from any other digital asset. No  other digital asset is likely to improve upon bitcoin as a monetary good  because bitcoin is the most (relative to other digital assets) secure,  decentralized, sound digital money and any ""improvement"" will  necessarily face tradeoffs.


* There is not necessarily mutual exclusivity between the success of  the Bitcoin network and all other digital asset networks. Rather, the  rest of the digital asset ecosystem can fulfill different needs or solve  other problems that bitcoin simply does not.


* Other non-bitcoin projects should be evaluated from a different perspective than bitcoin.

I am here to point out that at the moment, Tesla is the most undervalued tech/teracap (stocks that are or were once worth $1 trillion) stock measured by price to earnings growth. All the data will be here in this post.

But first, I want to address some folks here who think Tesla is overvalued because the P/E is 189 (which is down from 1,100 at the end of last year due to blistering fast earnings growth and will be under 100 if Tesla doesn't grow earnings from it's Q4 pace) while American automakers like Ford and GM have P/E around 12 and 7 respectively. Be prepared for some data. 

Tesla is not like Ford or GM and shall not be valued as such. The only similarity is that a majority of revenue comes from cars. However, Tesla is growing revenue much more like a tech company than a car company like for or GM. Tesla also has much higher margins than Ford and GM, and virtually no debt. They are also already 100% EVs while Ford and GM have to transition their sales to EVs. Here's the data :

&amp;#x200B;

**Tesla Revenue growth versus tech and cars**

&amp;#x200B;

|Company|Years to grow from $10B to $50B|Years to grow from $10B to $100B|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Facebook|4.25 years (2014-2018)|6 years (2014-2020)|
|**Tesla**|**4.5 years (2017-2021)**|**Estimated \~5.75 years (2017-2023)**|
|Apple|5 years (2005-2010)|6.25 years (2005-2011)|
|Amazon|5.25 years (2006-2012)|8.75 years (2006-2015)|
|Google |6.75 years (2006-2013)|10.75 years (2006-2017)|
|Microsoft|10.5 years (1996-2007)|21 years (1996-2017)|
|General Motors|17 years (1960-1977)|28 years (1960-1988)|
|Ford|21 years (1964-1985)|24 years (1964-1988)|

Clearly, Tesla is not like Ford and GM if it is growing 4-5x faster than GM and Ford in their heydays. Tesla is growing faster than even its tech company rivals. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Tesla net margin versus GM/Ford**

&amp;#x200B;

|Company|Q4/Q3 Net Margin|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Tesla**|**15%**|**Added back one time expense of CEO payroll taxes $340M**|
|General Motors|8.9%||
|Ford|5%||

Tesla is 2-3x more profitable than GM/F, and still expanding margins at a rapid pace. What's more, Tesla posted $2.32B in profits in Q4 2021 ($2.67B if you exclude the 1 time $340M payroll tax for Elon Musk's compensation package), while Ford and GM are expected to post \~$1.8B profit each for Q4 2021. Tesla has already surpassed Ford and GM's global profits (not margins, actual $) despite selling a fraction of the cars and still growing rapidly and expanding margins.

&amp;#x200B;

**Tesla Debt &amp; Cash versus GM/Ford**

&amp;#x200B;

|Company|Debt (short and long term)|Cash|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Tesla**|**$1.4 B**|**$18.967 B**|**Excluded finance/leasing debt, included marketable securities &amp; bitcoin**|
|General Motors|$16.848 B|$ 23.940 B|**Excluded finance/leasing debt, included marketable securities**|
|Ford|$24.007 B|$46.426 B|**Excluded finance/leasing debt, included marketable securities**|

Tesla has almost no debt burden compared to the heavy burden at GM/Ford.

&amp;#x200B;

Given this data, it is clear that Tesla's peers are not car companies, the peers are tech/teracap companies. Why is this a fair comparison despite the fact that most of Tesla's revenues come from cars, not tech? Some might say Tesla's cars contain a ton of tech and Tesla sells software for the cars and makes large amounts of money from it. I would say just look at the numbers. What industry a company is in does not actually matter for valuation, all that matters is growth, profits, and sometimes debt. 

&amp;#x200B;

**And now what you've been waiting for...**

Most people here know that Tesla's price to earnings ratio (stock price divided by earnings/profit per share) is 189 and \~100 (note this is based on GAAP financials) if you take the current earnings annual run rate in Q4 and think that this is astronomical. Well, Tesla's multiple is that high because you will always pay a higher price to earnings multiple for a companies that are growing fast. We can adjust companies forward (next year) price to earnings multiples by how fast they are anticipated to grow their earnings, and I have done exactly that in the table below for Tesla and other tech/teracap stocks:

&amp;#x200B;

|Company|Stock price				|2021 Analyst consensus EPS (Non-GAAP)|2022 Analyst consensus EPS (Non-GAAP)|2022 growth|Forward Price to Earnings|Price to earnings growth 2022|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Facebook|$311|$13.94|$14.24|2.15%|21.82|**10.14**|
|Google|$2,697|$108.64|$114.13|5.05%|23.63|**4.68**|
|Apple|$173|$6.04|$6.51|7.78%|26.64|**3.42**|
|Amazon|$2,892|$41.10|$49.41|20.22%|60.35|**2.98**|
|Microsoft|$309|$9.37|$10.77|14.94%|28.68|**1.92**|
|**Tesla**|**$935**|**$6.78**|**$10.78**|**59.00%**|**86.71**|**1.47**|

As shown clearly in the table, Tesla has the lowest price to earnings growth ratio of all the tech/teracap stocks at 1.47. It is true that Peter Lynch, who invented the price to earnings growth ratio, suggested that a price to earnings growth ratio of 1 represents a fairly valued company. However, Peter Lynch suggested that in 1989 when the average 10 year govt bond yield over 20 years was &gt;8% compared to &lt;2% today, so a fair price to earnings growth ratio is likely much higher than 1 today (based on a rule of thumb that 1% change in interest rates is worth about 10% change in tech valuations, a fair price to earnings growth ratio today might be \~1.6). Moreover, this table is being very conservative for Tesla, as it is taking the average wall street analyst consensus earnings estimate, which is way too low. I believe that Tesla's earnings per share is likely to exceed $13 per share, which would put the forward price to earnings growth ratio at 0.78, which is definitely undervalued given that pace of earnings growth.

However, investing is one of those odd activities where the fruit of the labor actually comes from inactivity and patience rather than constant activity.

As a result, constantly looking at your portfolio every day or even every hour for some people will most likely lead you to make short-term price-based decisions. More often than not, decisions based on price or how the market is doing on one particular day end up costing you a lot of money.

Here are some studies to help get some perspective on this:

1. Fidelity Study: This study revealed that the best-performing investors were ones who were inactive, forgot their password, or were already dead. Why? Because these accounts didn't make hasty trades and simply held their investments long term.
2. Putnam Investment Study: A study by Putnam Investment revealed that remaining invested between 2005 - 2020 would've made you an annualized 9.88% return in the S&amp;P. But if you missed just the 10 best trading days within this 15 yr period (just 10!) your annualized return would've been 4.31%.

Moreover, the company is just starting to exploit the revenue growth which can come from its iconic Warhammer IP. Licensing it out to companies such as CA who are releasing total war Warhammer III next year, Hasbro will be producing an MTG set based on Warhammer 40K and Panini have just announced that they will produce a range of Warhammer collectibles. Last year licensing income was £19 million, this clearly has much more room to grow. Furthermore, Eisenhorn a TV series (Hopefully featuring Henry Cavil a self-professed Warhammer fan) is being released soon, this along with their recently released Warhammer+ service can grant further growth.

I watched a video of a guy saying that you should use your dividends to reinvest to get more dividends, and eventually the annuity takes off since you are continuously reinvesting everything. That makes perfect sense to me. Eventually if you invest enough you can just live off the dividends, but that's after a tremendous amount of money.

However, I just don't understand how annuities could work with growth stocks. Isn't the point to just put the money in and let it grow? You aren't getting paid anything, so it won't grow to the point where you can get additional stocks from it like you could through reinvesting dividends right? Are there any annuities that snowball eventually like with dividends? 

And my last questions, how do people retire from growth stocks? You can't cut a stock in half to take out some money, and having a stock that says it's worth x amount is useless unless you actually sell it to get the money. So when you are retired, do you just sell all your portfolio? Or do you just sell parts periodically? Won't your portfolio eventually run out this way? It just seems like dividends are more useful to invest in since they offer the reinvestment option and it gives you a paycheck while the stock also grows

‌
I bet it was painfully brutal. The weeks full of tears. The instant anger at the sight of life itself. The endless worrying if your ex was already seeing someone else. The parking outside of their house from 9 p.m. to 4 a.m. with the lights off to watch if they went anywhere (or was that just ... ahh never mind there, let's keep it moving). 
‌
The point here being is that you were emotionally vulnerable. So vulnerable and raw in fact you probably took your ex back after their barrage of sweet-talk (or back in my day, after sending ""143"" 50 times to their translucent blue Motorola beeper). 
‌
I think this is where a legion of investors enter February following a painful start to the year for markets: vulnerable. 
‌
Many investors only know low interest rates (think here the sub 40-year-old crowd who has powered the market in recent years). They only know how to buy dips in stocks because the strategy has worked wonders this past decade. They only know tech stocks good (insert caveman voice), dividend-paying slower growing companies generally bad. Hence, they are vulnerable to late-in-the day rallying markets (as seen last week) blowing sweet nothings in their ear as if they were saying: ""I still love you, take me back baby please.""
‌
But the reality is that just like that ex, the market right now is dangerous as it works to price in anywhere from five (new Goldman Sachs call) interest hikes this year to seven (new Bank of America call). There will be a price to pay for higher interest rates as it pertains to the economy and markets, which is why stocks at present are experiencing wild volatility. Stocks are trying to figure out that price.
‌
So in my humble view, ignore the market's thirst traps it's posting into closes at the current moment. Stay disciplined during your vulnerable period. Just like your former heartbroken self, something better will come along ... in this case a better opportunity to get into stocks.

Looking for some advice.  
I will be using DeGiro as my broker and I'm based in The Netherlands. 

For the past two months I've been reading up on investing. I like the boglehead principle and want to begin passive investment for my future retirement. I am in my early 20's. For the past 2 weeks i've been putting together a portfolio. I originally came up with a plan to have 10 different ETF's. However, i came across this quote.   
""The education of an index investor, born in darkness, finds indexing enlightenment, overcomplicates everything, embraces simplicity""   
I realize i was making things too complicated, i realize i can't judge which region will do better. I want to just invest into one single world ETF. However, I'm stuck between two options. 

The first option:   
\- Vanguard FTSE All-World UCITS ETF (USD) Accumulating   
\- TER 0.22%   
\- No commission fee on DeGiro 

The second option:   
\- Vanguard FTSE All-World UCITS ETF (USD) Distributing   
\- TER 0.22%   
\- Has commission fee 

Im leaning towards the accumulating ETF. Because if i choose the distributing ETF i would need to add the dividends back and pay a commission fee each time i did this. Is this correct? If anyone knows of a better World ETF option please share it with me. 

My second question is a little more complicated. I have been following Ben Felix and am thinking about having a slight tilt in my portfolio towards SVC ETF's. Anyone know of any good ETFs that are low in cost that i can incorporate alongside an World ETF? What should my split be if i choose to do this? Should i just embrace simplicity and not even start. Any thoughts would be appreciated.

The main reason why I think $BLMH is undervalued at its current price of $0.26/share is that the occupational health company is providing high in demand covid testing services across the US. Just this month the company has obtained a state-wide contract for testing in Texas for K-12 schools for the remainder of the 2022 school year. $BLHM also has a contract for covid-testing in Alabama Schools.

Also, this January $BLHM opened a new facility in NJ, allowing the company to serve workforces (including fortune 500 clients, sporting events, film/TV productions, etc.)  in New York and other areas in the Northeastern US.

I was looking at the price graphs for gold and silver while wanting to buy some bullion as a ""safe"" long-term investment. However, out of curiosity I overlaid the long-term (1970-present) graphs for gold and silver and noted a stark runaway of gold growth relative to silver post-2008, excluding only 2012.

I know it's nothing useable professionally because it's two graphs with different price values, but it got me thinking. You can see the correlation in price between gold and silver, but that last year shows gold climbing while silver shrinks.

Gold production is higher than ever thanks to the increasing industrialisation of Africa and Eurasia, and I can't imagine that production/industrials demand from jewelery and electronics is keeping pace. Assuming the trend continues, I don't see how the current price of gold is sustainable as the safe, long-term investment it's touted as. Can any vets help me understand this?

With that out of the way, now, the financials. Every earnings report is a new high because every time they report they’re reporting more earnings and a better financial position. While their income statement is a bit sketchy, their balance sheet and cash flow statement are showing positive cash flows, and I believe partly because they’ve been doing such a good job at keeping expenses steady while bringing in more revenue (Revenue/COGS is a lot higher). Gross profits are way up along with operating income and their EBIDTA is $41,000,000 TTM.

I don’t know if these are great comparisons but BBW is outperforming nearly all of them T3M, and all but 1 TTM in appreciation of the stock.

Now that you see how profitable they've been and that they're competitive in their market, you may understand why the stock pumps so hard when they beat.  Right now, after revising their guidance upwards a few weeks ago, they're forecasting an EPS of 0.92, or an increase of nearly 250%, for their March 8th earnings report.

We had many great examples against such products in the past. However, everytime a specific sector outperforms, I see many people allocating a significant portion of their portfolio. 

In 2020 we had ICLN (Clean Energy), which dropped by almost 50% since it’s peak last year and has never come close to it‘s starting price in 2008. Disruptive Technology was also considered a safe bet for outperforming the market and many people posted portfolios with ARKK, down more than 50%. I also remember similar trends with 3D printing and Cannabis and I’m sure there are many more good examples in the past. 

The new big thing is semiconductors. Everybody needs some SOXX since we will always need more computer chips in the digital age we live in. What people miss though is that the semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and it has crashed multiple times before. 

SOXX is down 15% YTD which is only slightly more than the Nasdaq-100 to be fair. However, multiple companies in this sector have just released their quarterly numbers and the projections for the upcoming year are underwhelming. On top of that, the amount of investments to increase supply are staggering with intel spending 20 billion on a new factory and TSMC also building up supply significantly.

I can’t tell if SOXX will really underperform going forward but I want to warn people who think it’s a safe bet. 

TLDR: Thematic ETFs are made by marketing to sell higher fees and that’s about it. All you really need is a broad indexfund to cover stocks for your portfolio.

&amp;#x200B;

**Introduction**

Dear all Redditors, here is a long post about my personal experiment, I rented out digital ingame items to gamers. I would classify it as niche alternative investment. DO NOT think of this as financial advice in any shape or form. This is just what I did in my free time with my own money for entertainment only additionally, I do not have any affiliation with the site despite my normal use. Please find a simple FAQ below about the outlines of my experiment and general information about skins. At the end of the post you can see more information about the Experiment itself and my achieved results and Outlook.

&amp;#x200B;

**What is a skin, and what is the effect of it?**

Skins are virtual in game items that can change the look for a specific item in the game. This is visible for the owner of the skin and other players. These skins often only change the cosmetics of an item but not its behaviour. This results in them often having a Status symbol standing within the gaming world.

**Is it needed?**

Since skins are often purely cosmetics, they are not needed to play the game itself, however for consumers of different games its very common to own a skin or to. For some people it can increase the enjoyment, be a kind of collectable or even be regarded as an investment.

**Is it trade- / exchange able?**

Skins can be tradable in some cases or bound to an account, this varies from game to game.

**Quick overview of Counterstrike the game**

Counterstrike is one of the older Franchises in the gaming world and fans of the game are often very loyal to the game itself. Counterstrike is a free to play online game which is getting updated and evolved without a fully new release of the game. This is different in comparison to Games like FIFA, F1, NFL and so on, which get updated and newly released on a yearly basis.

**Will it stay in the Game or become obsolete?**

Skins can be bound to the specific version of a game, which means if a new version get released the skin can be non-transferable. Therefore, skins can often be regarded as bound to a game version for example Counterstrike Global Offensive. If a new Counterstrike is released we have no information about what happens with the skins.

**Where to buy skins**

Skins are often sold in the game itself or over a community platform like steam. Furthermore, skins can also often be purchased on 3rd party websites. Hereby its important to take great care, as not all these sites are reputable and post a potential risk to being scammed.

**Trade Locking on a skin (time i can not transfer a skin)**

Skins can also be soft bound to an account for a limited time duration. This is specifically done in Counterstrike with a skin being untradeable for 7 days after it changed owner. After this time is over, the skin itself becomes tradeable once again. However as mentioned before not all skins are tradeable. Furthermore every game handles this differently and skins can be non tradeable.

**Fees in the skin market**

Fees are often passed to the seller. Posting a skin on a site is often free but once the sell is completed the site itself takes a cut, this is usually a very large percentile and can reach up to 20% in some cases. However, the buyer doesn’t have any fees.

&amp;#x200B;

**Data**

Data for historical prices can be collected over the internet to some extend. The quality is significantly lower compared to historical data from Stocks. As a result of this the price changes of the individual skins is not rcorded in this post and is a general topic of its own.

**Prices used**

There is a difference in prices from market prices to purchase prices since the skins can be bought under market value (steam market value) on third party sites. To reduces the complexity of this topic I decided just to record the initial investment (what have I paid in USD to get started). Furthermore, the Status of my experiment is ongoing, this makes calculating my sale value quite open for my personal bias and the selling fees would impact my returns on a significant basis.

**Returns collected**

Returns are accounted monthly for 2021 and from January 2022 from the 1 January to the 27 January.

**The experiment**

I decided to create a skin “portfolio” and rent these skins out on lootbear.com to generate passive income. This experiment is ongoing since over one year and I plan to continue. This is not hypothetical I used my own money for this experiment to achieve a better quality.

**Skin selection**

During my experiment I found significance importance of the skin itself. Not everything can be rented out to generate income. Not all my selected skins were successful therefore I reshuffled my portfolio a little with equal value skins. This however is ignored once again to reduce the complicity.

**Return structure**

The returns were less consistent than I was hoping for with an overall negative trend. The minimum returns were in December with 36.97 USD. And the maximum in May with 92.2 USD. The total earnings in 2021 of the Portfolio were 756.66 USD. Furthermore, the negative down trend was already broken in January 2022 with a recorded earning of 44.06 with 4 days left of January.

The portfolio value of 4'000 USD consisted of  3’000 USD for the invested money (new money for the experiment) and 1’000 USD for the already owned skins. With the start capital of 4’000 USD and the 756.66 USD in earnings a yearly performance of 18.92% was achieved in 2021. The monthly returns ranged from 0.92% (worst 36.97) and 2,31% (best 92.2) and  were quite subjected to change (high inconsistency). Within the returns a general linear negative trend was present.

**Reinvesting**

From the earnings, around 500 USD was reinvested in to the skin portfolio. The remaining 256 USD were withdrawn to my personal account

&amp;#x200B;

**Outlook and future of the experiment**

I will continue the experiment, however i will strictly limit it to self reinvesting.

**Comparing to other asset classes**

Comparing to other asset classes for example Stocks with dividends or Obligations, returns seem to be significant and excessive. However, this must be taken with a grain of salt since the portfolio within the experiment is subject to major risks, I mean **major risks**. See below under risk. Furthermore the collected data is small and limited therefore it is hard to make a comparison. Maybe i just got lucky.

**Risk involved**

This “Alternative” portfolio came with major risks. Since if a new version of the game gets released, the skins could become worthless within seconds. Risk of Scam is also high since a lot of this sites are not on the same trust and regulation level as Banks and regulated brokers, not even by a long shot. If the skins become account bound permanently the portfolio is wipe out within a second and non-recoverable.

**Forecasting**

The year 2021 showed a negative trend in my earnings however this was due to multiple factors such as rise of skin value. This rise in value made some skins to expensive to be rented out and therefore resulted in unused capital. In 2022 I “rebalanced” the portfolio to negate the effect. Still, I think a realistic return for this portfolio would be around the 50 USD mark. This would mean a Return of around 1.25% (50/4000) monthly. This seems to be a very high but realistic number and I will update on my journey if the community is interested.

Regarding Scalability, I am not fully convinced my project is scalable, therefore I focus on improving my skin selection process (the quality of the individual parts of the portfolio). Maybe more to this in the future but since there is major risk involved, I am hesitant to put more money towards this fun entertainment project.

Hello

I have just started with some investment, using Degiro. I know investment is a risk, markets are up and down and all that kind of stuff and maybe I will lose some money or not just by doing it. Whatever. I plan to be more conservative and I want to buy mainly ETFs (VWCE, VUSA, CSPX, IUSA) also with some Small Caps (IUS3, IUSN, ZPRX). Of course long term - just buying every month for 20 years. Not with much interest what is going on. Just ETFs and chill. Anyway. Minimum level of compensation per investor of €20,000,on my assests, is something what bothers me a little. I can understand that I can loose money because of my poor decisions and because of market situation. But not so much that some mothefu\*\*er have a bad day and decide to ruin mine. Okey, I can believe there are nice people in Degiro, but will they be there also for another 20 years? Who knows right? If degiro goes bust I can imagine the situation ""sorry we are out of business"" phones and mails dead and maybe I will get something from my investment just because of some separate custodian entity but it will take a lot of time and it's gonna be pain in the ass.

So, how do you cope with possibility of this happening? Do you have your own mechanism of multiple brokers or do you just believe and leave it to live its own life and hope for the best?

Its P/E is 33 and change, but its FORWARD P/E is just 10.85. (It announces earnings tomorrow before market open.) 

Now this isn't some hotshot whizbang company like TSLA with a bright future (and even TSLA's forward P/E is only 2x the trailing P/E btw). It's an old company in a mature, in fact shrinking, industry. They sell CIGARETTES. In AMERICA. In 2022. You can look at its asymptotic downward growth graph. Anyone who thinks Its growth will triple next year, or ever, has gotta be smoking something stronger than Marlboros.  So from whence this apparent wacky prediction of a massive earnings increase? Or, since it is after all a ratio, is it an implicit prediction of a 60% price drop?  

Wrapping up, who cooks up these forward P/E figures? Analysts? The companies themselves? Do diff analysts and firms publish diff figures or do they improbably reach a consensus? RBC Capital helpfully seems to be rating the company simultaneously as ""outperform"" and ""underperform,"" according to a press release today, so there's that.

Thanks very much for any help with this frankly embarrassing question."|investing|I thought I understood P/E but now this...|1.0|0.53

* What are your objectives with this money? (Buy a house? Retirement savings?)  
* What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?

I use a financial advisor and have been doing so for years.  Doing just fine to point where I have the opportunity to take long shots like this. 

I wanted to get an idea of what some random people on reddit would do if they had 25k to invest in whatever right now. Should I put it into index funds, reits, mutual funds, crypto?

I do want it to be longterm 2 years minimum. I know I'm going to get some crazy responses so I please ask you all to at least explain your reasoning on why you think it's the best option to do xyz.


Edit: 5 years minimum, but if it's going good I'd keep it for 20 years if it's giving out good dividends.
Leaning towards vtsax for more long term but it needs to dip more. Same with qqq and voo and vti, all those are still mountains. If they dip another 20 percent then I'm going in. Will know by March.

Not trying to buy into multiple stuff. Trying to keep it simple (one or two max).

I live in a high cost of living area and rotate from east and west coast so I won't be buying any real estate anytime soon. Waiting for the housing market to crash so until then it's more cost efficient to rent. 10 years ago you could put down 25k on a decent property and have no pmi insurance. Today you need at least 100k for the same property. I won't buy in the ghetto."|investing|Where should I put end of the year bonus (25k)|13.0|0.63

Can someone explain this for me, how can this person own 1.5M Shares then jump to 160M Shares without a purchase history? (Finviz) (Imgur Link is in description)

As per title, Basically, and then he goes back down to 1.3M Stocks but no sell orders/history that big. How is this possible?



An explanation would be appreciated.

&gt;Bill Ackman, the hedge fund billionaire, has bought a $1.1bn stake in Netflix as he seeks to capitalise on a sharp sell-off that has almost halved the streaming company’s market value in the past few months. 

&gt;Pershing Square, Ackman’s investment group, has bought 3.1m shares of Netflix in recent days, making him a top-20 shareholder in the company, according to a letter to investors. At the current share price of $359.70, this equates to a stake of $1.1bn. 

&gt;“Many of our best investments have emerged when other investors, whose time horizons are short term, discard great companies at prices that look extraordinarily attractive when one has a long-term horizon”, Ackman wrote.

&gt;Netflix’s stock price has dropped more than 40 per cent from an October peak of about $700 per share. The stock sold off more than 20 per cent on Friday after the company warned subscriber growth would slow substantially in the first three months of 2022."|investing|Bill Ackman buys Netflix stake worth $1.1bn after stock sell-off|1686.0|0.97

&gt;Swiss bank UBS has agreed to buy Wealthfront, a U.S.-focused automated wealth management provider with more than $27 billion in assets under management, in an all-cash deal the two companies said was worth $1.4 billion.

&gt;The acquisition of Wealthfront, which has more than 470,000 clients in the United States and caters to well-off millennial and Gen Z investors, is set to close in the second half of 2022.

&gt;""UBS will accelerate its growth ambitions in the U.S., broaden the firm's reach among affluent investors and expand its distribution and capabilities,"" the two companies said in a statement on Wednesday.

&gt;Wealthfront will become a wholly owned subsidiary of UBS (UBSG.S) and will operate as a business within UBS Global Wealth Management Americas, they added.

&gt;""Adding Wealthfront's capabilities and client base to our global investment ecosystem will significantly boost our ability to grow our business in the U.S.,"" UBS CEO Ralph Hamers said.

&gt;UBS Investment Bank is acting as financial adviser to UBS and Sullivan &amp; Cromwell is legal counsel. Qatalyst Partners is Wealthfront's financial adviser and Fenwick &amp; West is acting as legal counsel, the statement said.

When we take the peaks in the price and draw a line, and then we draw another line at the major support ($21.50), there's a beautiful descending triangle. We are at the end of it, the price wiggles up and down, and is about to make a strong upward move (in my opinion).

I have read The Little Book of Common Sense Investing by John Bogle which seems to summarize down to, leave your money in an S&amp;P500 fund, keep paying into it until you are ready to retire, take profits out only at retirement. The data presented in the book was quite compelling which had me thinking if an S&amp;P500 ETF was the optimal choice in long term  investing. 

I started looking into historical returns, going back from the early 50s to the end of 2019 before the pandemic started. What I found out from these 70 years of returns was that although the S&amp;P500 is an incredible investment long term, investing specifically in US Small Cap stocks would yield over double the returns over the same time period. 

Someone please tell me if I'm incorrect because I'm still new to all this, but assuming that is correct, would it not be ideal to focus on small cap US stocks? Obviously the big drawback is the increased volatility of small caps (S&amp;P500 has been winning out in the recent short-term), but with a longer time horizon I feel like this is the way to go to optimize returns.

This is meant to shed light on past geopolitical events and their affect on markets. The human tragedy already seen as a result the conflict is apparent, with over 15,000 deaths among Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian Ukrainian separatists that have been fighting since 2015 (according to Reuters). 

Russia has built a troop count of over 100,000 at the border and NATO and its allies have begun shipping troops, weapons, and ammunition to the region. US an European leaders continue to assess their options after meetings with Kremlin leaders have went largely nowhere. Economic sanctions are likely should Russia continue on their path. Ukraine, a former Soviet bloc country, is on a path to joining NATO which Putin and Russia vehemently oppose. Russia still views Ukraine as an extension of Russia and wishes to keep Ukraine under their wing to avoid further NATO ""intrusion"" so close to their land. 

The story is gaining more momentum in mainstream news, and effects have found their way to the jittery stock market, but with the recent sell-off, the story has remained somewhat on the backburner in financial circles. 

As tensions escalate, I thought it would be useful to put together a few data points on how markets have reacted to past geopolitical events. 

**State Street examined 71 geopolitical events from 1986-2018.** The full study is [here.](https://www.ssga.com/investment-topics/general-investing/2018/09/does-geopolitics-affect-financial-markets.pdf) A few takeaways include:

\- The largest effects seen were in currency and equity markets.

\- Equity markets typically respond quickly in a strong negative/positive fashion and remain depressed/elevated for about 1-2 months. As seen in the [chart](https://imgur.com/c7ryJ1e), the initial reaction is quite dramatic, but markets tend to rationalize as more clarity comes

\- [Volatility](https://imgur.com/GQxNpPP) and risk tend to spike right away as well, following both positive and negative events, only to recede slightly a month after the event 

**BlackRock also publishes a ""Geopolitical Risk Indicator"" found** [here](https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/insights/blackrock-investment-institute/interactive-charts/geopolitical-risk-dashboard). The indicator is aimed to measure not the potential for geopolitical conflict, but the market's *attention* to geopolitical risks. 

BlackRock's [indicator](https://imgur.com/xVv6Az2) has been negative for the last year, indicating investors have not been paying much attention to geopolitical risks since Biden took office, and perhaps it's too little attention. 

&amp;#x200B;

The data here is from two companies and is not all-encompassing, but it suggests riding out geopolitical risks may be better for long-term performance if you can withstand the short-term volatility that comes with it.

I am aware that traditionally monopolies when it comes to mergers and getting denied FTC regulation permission are usually lateral acquisitions of similarly sized companies looking to gain a huge market share against competitors, however Microsoft is a far, far larger company than Activision.  I've read that with a vertical acquisition, the deal is unlikely to be seen as a monopoly.    


However, could Microsoft in part be buying Activision to take ownership of a huge console franchise, Call of Duty to curb or capitalize on Playstation sales?  Would Microsoft then make Call of Duty an XBOX exclusive and could this then be considered a monopoly considering how much a cash cow and income base COD is?    


I don't mean to have a conversation on the quality of the COD games, that's a different discussion, but the fact remains, whether they are quality or not, people buy COD games and they generate huge revenue.

And if I have to guess, I'd say there is about 70/30 chance of a bit more pain to come between now and June 2022. Heck, even BRK.B has pulled back 6% from its recent ATH. (I am not in the Jeremy Grantham's camp of 50% more crash from here, at least not yet)

But I think a few lessons can be drawn at this point.

First, you need a broader investment universe in your toolbox, not just tech, and certainly not just household names like TSLA. That does not mean that you have to stay invested in all of them, but knowing about other sectors is half the battle. If your first instinct to a tech correction is to do the revenge trade of buying puts or shorting those tech plays that you were previously longed on, your investment universe is too narrow.

Second, educate yourself on the cyclicality of equity and other macro factors. I find it misleading that Buffet humbly claim that he is not knowledgeable about the macro conditions during his talks. The guy knows (and has known since 1950s) a crazy amount about the interplay between macro conditions and equity. If nothing else, your knowledge allows you to understand and act/do nothing during market swings.

Third, stay skeptical and humble during bull/bear markets. Even though I am also a millennial, I was very lucky for not fomoing into these growth tech trade during the entirety of 2020 and 2021. Part of that was because I was a value investor by nature but also because I was taught by my upbringing to listen to the elders. So naturally I read up on the older investors, who tend to be value. **Some people of my generation will stop investing in equity for the rest of their lives due to this correction, some more will stop picking stocks altogether in favor of index funds, and many more will forswear growth tech forever and ever**.

With rising stock prices and trend movements establishing, greed also arises! Every market participant wants to get their piece of the cake. This increasing demand is driving stock prices higher and higher. In the final phase of such a trend movement, ""euphoria"" can often even be observed, even if the last market participant is buying. “The bull market feeds the bull market”! ""The trend is your friend""! A ""rational"" market behavior gives rise to an emotional ""irrational"" behavior, which can also have strange consequences.

there is no denying that we had a long, very pronounced bull market.
Whether and how much he corrects is the big question!

you can only look at what phases a bull market usually goes through.

Scheme for a typical bullish trend behavior!

If more and more stockbrokers own shares, then fewer and fewer investors are willing or able to continue buying. Demand falls, the price begins to stagnate and the first profit-taking sets in. A euphoric mood, in which many market participants are heavily invested, quickly deteriorates and turns into the opposite. Fear of falling prices and disproportionate losses arises. Dwindling profits or real losses prompt traders to sell as soon as possible. The fear of loss is getting stronger, especially with credit-financed transactions, and panic sets in. Panic selling sets in, volatility rises and the media promises “doomsday”!

Do we already have a correction, or is it yet to come, or will everything be atypical this time?

No one can answer that question for sure, but looking at the posts of the last few weeks, you can see more and more fear of an end to the days when investing was so easy and you just had to buy on setbacks to be among the winners.

in the long term, the stock market will rise, but if you have linked your performance to that of an index, you have to be able to live with the ups and downs of the index.

If you have problems with corrections because your investment is performing worse than others, you should check the composition of your portfolio.
(also the S&amp;P 500, as diversified as it is, has a stronger presence in some markets and technologies)

The faster and further an investment has risen, the faster and lower the price can have fallen. Anyone who is sitting on disproportionate profits should ask themselves why the prices were able to rise so much and whether it can continue like this.

comments like: ""Stop chasing quick bucks and focus on long-term success. Apple (for example) had a 500% return over five years. Slow and steady.""

what does a ""slow and steady correction"" look like then? and should one just sit it out or is it appropriate to shift one's portfolio to less risk or even to take profits, be it something to be able to sleep more soundly or to be able to react better to volatile market behavior?

Worst case scenario, market valuations return back to the high end of ""normal"" this year. Historically, forward P/E peaked around 16x to 17x. [Ed Yardeni](https://www.yardeni.com/pub/yriearningsforecast.pdf) currently has 2023 S&amp;P 500 earnings estimates of 250. So, if you assume that earnings meet 2022 estimates and 2023 estimates don't change much over the course of the year (a big assumption, I know), and you take your 2023 estimate of 250 and a normal-ish fwd P/E ratio of 17x, you then have a downside case scenario with a year end price target of 4,250. That's only a 3.4% decline from where we already are. It's simply not worth selling or making large changes to your portfolio (and missing potential upside) when the downside is only 3.5% from where we are today, 1/22/2022.

And that's the downside. Currently, 2022 earnings estimates are at about 225, so with a 4,400 S&amp;P 500 we're at a 19.5x FWD P/E ratio. Last year, we beat the early earnings estimates from January by over 15%. Also, there's potential for FWD P/E to remain elevated and not retrace all the way to 17x. If you assume we only drop to an 18x FWD P/E ratio, and 2023 earnings estimates shift up by only 5% to 262.5, that gives us a 2022 year end price of 4,725 which is a 7% increase from where we are today...a completely normal 12 month equity return.

And remember that even companies like Netflix that are giving bad guidance are still crushing earnings estimates. Additionally, Netflix raised it's price by $2 the week before it got killed for earnings. I highly doubt a significant amount of people are going to cancel over that $2 increase. This is to say, there is real potential for earnings to meet or exceed expectations.

There will certainly be volatility along the way, and even if the fed makes a ""policy error"", they are going to just pivot. But I believe Powell is going to successfully avoid having to do a huge pivot like in late 2018/early 2019 where rates went up too quickly, credit markets froze, and the fed had to reverse course.

Overall, markets are going nowhere fast. There is just no way that with nosebleed valuations and rising rates, the market is going to have another double digit year in 2022. This is why Is old $20,000 in stocks and maxed out 2021/2022 Series I bonds in December and January. Even still, there is no better alternative, and with inflation as high as it is and rates near zero, TINA.

**UPDATE**:

See the chart below to demonstrate my point.

P/E Multiple Range: We spent most of 2021 at about a 21x FWD P/E multiple. As of 1/22/2023, we've compressed to about a 19.5x FWD P/E multiple. The high end of my sensitivity analysis assumes further compression to 19x, assuming that higher rates are already mostly priced in to earnings yields. The low-end assumes we get all the way back to a very normal non-bubblish 16x FWD P/E multiple.

Earnings Range: Last year we beat January earnings estimates by over 15%. In my sensitivity analysis, I'm assuming that we are either +/- 5% current earnings estimates. I'm trusting the experts on this one and I think a +/- 5% range is very reasonable. Last year we were still emerging from lockdowns so the margin of error was going to be larger. Despite higher inflation, lower wage workers are getting raises, offsetting the loss of stimulus checks, and sparing company earnings as they flex pricing power.

Conclusion: Personally, I think the fed has weak hands and thanks to a pivot we are going to end the year around 4,900. That said, I wouldn't argue with someone who says we could end the year as low as 4,000. 4,000 is another 9% drop from where we are and a 17% drop from the all time high. Either way, that wouldn't even count as a ""bear"" market, and is a far way from the calls for a big 50% market crash. And I stand by the thought that the fed is not going to let a 50% market crash happen for the sake of 7% inflation. A 50% crash doesn't happen without credit market dysfunction and if credit markets don't function then we're going to have deflation and as we all know, deflation is worse than inflation.

*I would love to come back to this matrix at year end and see where we end up. First round is on me if we end up ""off the charts"" in either direction.*

To start with, AAPL posted its best string of 4 quarters since 2012.  They grew quarterly revenues by an average of 35% YoY:

[https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AAPL/apple/revenue](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AAPL/apple/revenue)

The only other 4Q stretch with a comparable average in that time span was Q4-2014 to Q3-2015 where they averaged \~25% revenue growth.  So this has been an incredible 4 quarter run for Apple.  They have seen price growth from both multiple expansion and sales growth in that time frame.  Between 2009 and 2019, this stock traded below a 20 PE.

Why?  Because the market stopped viewing it as a growth stock.  Today that's all changed and it's going for a PE of 29+.  Until it shows signs of slowing, this PE is more than reasonable.  Apple's EPS rose by 66.22% YoY for Q3 in 2021.  A single year of 45%+ EPS growth would compress their current PE ratio below 20.  This company is absolutely worth the high PE right now, unless you have reason to believe their earnings will start disappointing this quarter and beyond.

A PE ratio is a snapshot in time.  Growing your profit at a 65% clip YoY cuts your PE ratio by over a third in one year.  Even at half the earnings growth from last year, it would be undervalued today, IMO.  That would put it at around 22 PE next year at current prices.  Hardly expensive for a company like Apple in a growth spurt.

Now let's check out **GOOG**:

This one is my favorite.  While stocks like Apple have much more volatile earnings growth over the past decade, GOOG is nearly the most reliable grower you could ever find.  And they've also had a ridiculous past 4 quarters, posting average revenue growth of 40% YoY on a quarterly basis for the past 4 quarters.  

[https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GOOG/alphabet/revenue](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GOOG/alphabet/revenue)

Google has only had 2 negative revenue growth quarters YoY since 2006.  This includes the GFC, rising interest rates in 2018, and COVID.  This thing just keeps churning out more money every single quarter.  Their earnings growth is more sporadic, but for good reason.  They are heavily reinvesting into R&amp;D and are dominant in many different verticals.

YouTube is Google.  Maps are Google.  Android is Google.  Play Store is Google.  Gmail is Google.  Chrome is Google.  Cloud.  Their autonomous vehicle project Waymo is widely regarded as the industry leader.  And of course Google Search is the most lucrative advertising engine in the history of the Earth.

Google also trades at a low PE historically.  Today it's about 25.7.  The lowest it's been since 2015 is \~21 in 2019.  This is a company that is heavily prioritizing revenue growth over earnings.  There are many times in history where Google was trading at 30, 40, even 50 PE ratio.  They spent 42% of their net income this year ($30B) on Research &amp; Development.  

If you added that back into their NI, they'd be trading at a PE below 20.  On a company which grows revenue in 96%+ of every quarter since 2006.

Next up, let's look at **MSFT:**

MSFT, similarly to Apple, had a rough Q2-2015 to Q2-2016.  Big negative revenue growth.  Since then though, they've increased YoY quarterly revenue in 95% of every quarter.  The only other negative quarter since was -3.19% (Q2-2017).  Their average quarterly YoY revenue growth since Q2-2016 is about 15%.

This one is trading at a 33.74 PE ratio.  Definitely on the higher end since 2006, but MSFT was a bit lost once Apple released the iPhone.  The market overestimated the importance of mobile to the company.    In the last 4 quarters MSFT has averaged 45% YoY revenue growth.  They also have better gross margins than Apple / Google.

MSFT is probably fine, but their history shows volatility in revenue growth and their multiple is higher than their peers.  I have no doubt the company will continue to crush long term, but I think it's the riskier buy right now, because they are trading much higher than their traditional PE.  A single earnings miss could easily cost them 15%+ in this environment.

Finally we have **AMZN**:

AMZN is the GOAT at revenue growth.  Even Google can't touch the consistency of AMZN.  Since 2006, their YoY quarterly revenue growth has always been positive.  Think about how absurd that is.  60+ quarters of consistent revenue growth.  

[https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMZN/amazon/revenue](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMZN/amazon/revenue)

Even crazier, their lowest YoY quarterly revenue growth in that timespan... 14.6% (Q4-2014).  What an absurd company.  They had some massive growth during the height of the Pandemic.  They've had trouble growing on top of those big gains, but they ARE still growing, even compared to their revenues during the lockdowns of 2020 when everyone was using Amazon for everything.

Q4 earnings will obviously be a big deal here since they get a big boost for the holidays.  It will be difficult to top their $125.55B in revenue from Q4 2020, but the market seems to believe it's possible.  10% growth in revenue YoY would be their slowest quarterly gain since 2006, so the bar is pretty high!

This is a company which has historically traded at huge PE.  Amazon has continued to prioritize growth and there's no reason to doubt them now.  E-commerce has really been put on fast forward through the Pandemic.  Not to mention their AWS platform which prints money.  

They also spend huge on R&amp;D.  $42.7B in 2020.  That's about twice their Net Income.  So if you combine that with their earnings, their PE is slashed by 66% to 19.75.  If you want to talk moats, Amazon's ecommerce platform is insane.  The amount of investment and efficiency needed to provide their service is just unimaginable.  

Walmart is the nearest with their Walmart+ subscription, which they claim has 32M users.  Amazon Prime has over 200M.  Amazon has also made a big step into video games.  They own Twitch, the top streaming platform, and their New World MMORPG has gotten some good traction.  Long story short, Amazon's cemented into our lives and is not going anywhere.  Plenty of potential new countries for global expansion as well.

**Overall environment:**

**Are these stocks trading at historically high multiples?**  That seems to have been the narrative over the past year or two.  Multiple expansion due to the Fed's easy money policies.  Valuations outpacing results.  In terms of Big Tech, I'm not really seeing this.  Especially in AMZN and GOOG, the multiples are at historically low levels.

Multiples are also irrelevant without factoring in growth.  These companies have increased earnings and revenues at a huge clip since COVID.  The world has become increasingly online.  While this effect may subside slightly, there is some permanence to it as well.  We have permanently changed the way we work and our behavior.  

If these companies can continue to grow revenues, which AMZN and GOOG have done in over 95% of quarters dating back to 2006, they will continue to greatly outperform the market in the medium/long term.  The current valuations seem:

* Bad-very bad if growth slows considerably or goes negative
* Fine if growth slows and trends towards historic averages
* Good-great if growth continues at current rates
* Amazing if growth accelerates

So unless you are expecting a major reversal on big tech earnings, and think that the companies will start seeing considerable revenue growth contraction, my opinion is that these stocks are actually pretty cheap at these prices.  My top pick is GOOG which will benefit from reopening, since they will capture growth from travel industry and other reopening plays.  While some stocks may see headwinds from a reopened world, GOOG seems to win either way.  They're also priced very reasonably on a historic basis."|investing|A Little Analysis on Big Tech (GOOG, MSFT, AAPL, AMZN)|28.0|0.89

I would love some input and feedback on my long-term investment strategy. I am in my early 20's and unbeknownst to me until recently, a family member wrote some bonds in my name. I just cashed them out and while I do not want to give specifics, I have a sizable amount of $ to invest. 

I currently have about 75% of my portfolio in ETFs (long-term, do not touch), 15% in individual stocks, and 10% in crypto. I studied Finance in college and started investing in 2020.

I have been seeing some negative returns during this market downturn over the past 6ish months. Some of my top holdings include VTI, VGT, IBB in addition to many tech stocks and BTC/ETH. 

My question for y'all is, do you think I should add this new $ into the same asset allocation or consider other options? With rising interest rates I know that we are going to see lots of change.

In addition, the penetration rate of new energy vehicles in China is also rising rapidly. In terms of last December's data, the Chinese retail penetration of new energy vehicles was 22.6% and the annual penetration rate was 14.8%, a significant increase from 5.8% in 2020.

However, investment institutions believe that in the medium and long term, guided by the background of **the ""Peak Carbon Dioxide Emissions and Carbon Neutrality"" target**, the market for EV has not yet ended.

**Essence Securities** expects the new energy vehicle industry to be fully positive in 2022. The bank said that the scale expansion of new energy vehicles and technological advances have brought about continued improvement in cost reduction; at the same time, with the implementation of the decreased subsidy and rising raw material prices, the prices of some models have seen an upward adjustment, but still does not reduce consumer demand. New energy vehicle production and sales are expected to continue to grow in 2022.

**Cinda Securities** pointed out that under the global carbon-neutral consensus, the new energy vehicle track has long-term certainty. In recent years, the Chinese new energy vehicle market has entered the consumer-driven and sales repeatedly exceed expectations, continuing to boom.

**Which stocks are worthy of attention?**

**CITIC Securities** said that 2022 is expected to become the first year of rapid development of the battery swap industry with the improvement of policies, capital, and its own product strength. And it is expected that the industry will add more than 3,000 new battery swap stations. In 2025, there might be more than 10,000 stations, which expand 10 times in five years.

[Graph of performance](https://imgur.com/a/KXBQipe)
Value traps are facts of life for value managers. A stock suffering from some temporary dark clouds appears temptingly cheap, and like the call of Sirens, it entices the intrepid Value manager. Alas, the company’s fundamentals disappoint yet again. It was a trap. The clouds were not temporary. And the market rightfully punishes the stock price further.
Cautionary tales of Value traps are taught in finance texts around the world, and the term is a longstanding part of investment lexicon.
Although most investors have never heard the term, “Growth traps” are even more insidious. The seduction is different, borne from grand narratives of disruptive technologies, hyper-growth, and breathtaking breakthroughs. But Growth stocks are no less prone to disappointment – there’s actually evidence they are slightly more likely to disappoint at certain points in the cycle1 – and their punishment can be even more dire.
The chart above tracks a basket of Value and Growth trap stocks over 25 years.2 Value traps have underperformed their respective universe by a painful 9.5% per year. Growth traps have underperformed by an excruciating 13.0% per year.
This makes sense: Growth stocks have lofty investor expectations, so when they fail to deliver, investors are merciless. Managers who get fooled are more likely to blow that name out of the portfolio, which is part of the reason we don’t hear much about them. Unfortunately, by then the damage is already done, and history shows there is a 30% to 40% chance that the stock will be replaced with yet another trap.3
Why shine a light on growth traps today? Growth stocks around the world are priced with exceedingly high expectations.4 Recent names that have disappointed have been mercilessly repriced. What can you do about it? Lots. We’ve built a globally diversified short basket of stocks (part of a long-short strategy called Equity Dislocation) that is chock-full of candidates we believe are likely to fall short of the unrealistic expectations implied by their valuations. We have other strategies that can exploit this phenomenon in a multi-asset framework. Maintaining a Quality bias at a reasonable price is yet another way to play this. No matter, there are ways to navigate these dangerous waters.

1 See [GMO Quarterly letter, Q2, 2021](https://www.gmo.com/asia/research-library/2q-2021-gmo-quarterly-letter/)  for more detail on our Value and Growth trap research.

2 We had some discussion over how to define companies that disappoint. We didn’t want poor stock market performance to be part of the definition because that seemed like cheating. Looking at companies whose earnings disappoint is tricky because earnings forecasts are both gamed by analysts and companies, and because the definition of earnings reported by a company might be different from what the analysts used for their forecasts. The definition of sales isn’t as fuzzy, but single sales disappointment does not seem to do justice to the idea of a “trap.” So we decided on a definition that required both a disappointment in sales relative to forecasts and a drop in future sales estimates.

This is not true for a Value manager, who is more likely to hold on to some of these disappointing names given they were disappointments in the first place.

&gt;Shares of Peloton Interactive Inc. were cratering Thursday after a report indicated that the company temporarily planned to halt production of its connected exercise equipment to help curb costs in a period of slowing demand.

&gt;Peloton’s stock were off nearly 19% in Thursday afternoon trading and hovering below the company’s initial-public-offering price for the first time since April 2020. The shares were halted four times during the session following the report from CNBC, which said that Peloton was cutting its forecast for demand and pausing production of several products.

&gt;The company made its public debut on the Nasdaq at $29 a share back in September of 2019, before the coronavirus crisis took hold in earnest. The shares closed as high as $167.42 on Jan. 13, 2021 but they recently changed hands at $25.81 in Thursday’s session.

&gt;The maker of home-exercise products was a big winner early in the pandemic as people increasingly turned to its bikes and treadmills for pandemic-safe workouts that could offer a similar vibe to live, in-person exercise classes. But the company miscalculated demand as the economy reopened and slashed its forecast during its most recent earnings report.

&gt;“It is clear that we underestimated the reopening impact on our company and the overall industry,” Chief Financial Officer Jill Woodworth said on the company’s last earnings call in early November.

&gt;The CNBC report noted that Peloton intended to halt production of its regular exercise bike for two months after the company already halted manufacturing of the more expensive Bike+ model in December. The company also plans to curb production of its Tread treadmill for six weeks, per the report, which added that Peloton doesn’t expect that it will produce any Tread+ products during the 2022 fiscal year.

&gt;Business Insider reported earlier this week that Peloton planned to make substantial layoffs within its sales and marketing teams. CNBC also reported that the company was working with consultants from McKinsey &amp; Co. to evaluate the company’s expenses and to consider potential job cuts.

&gt;Peloton didn’t respond to MarketWatch’s request for comment on its production or staffing plans.

&gt;The reports come as Peloton executives recently said the company would add $250 and $350 in delivery and set-up costs to its original Bike and Tread, respectively. Peloton pegged the price increases to supply-chain costs.

&gt;While the sales of fancy exercise equipment are a key part of Peloton’s business model, the company also sells a membership that gives existing Peloton owners access to workouts and classes. The company has a separate membership offering for those who don’t use Peloton equipment.

&gt;Peloton’s stock has now lost more than 70% over the past three months, and it has plunged 84% since closing at its post-pandemic peak of $167.42 on Jan. 13, 2021. The company is set to report its quarterly results on Feb. 8.

Combined with the report that company insiders recently [sold $500M worth of stocks](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/19/peloton-insiders-sold-nearly-500-million-in-stock-before-its-big-drop-.html) right before the big drop, it's hard to imagine a bullish scenario for the company.

Ironically, it was the Peloton shareholders who were taken for a ride.

From CNBC:

&gt;Peloton is temporarily halting production of its connected fitness products as consumer demand wanes and the company looks to control costs, according to internal documents obtained by CNBC.

&gt;Peloton plans to pause Bike production for two months, from February to March, the documents show. It already halted production of its more expensive Bike+ in December and will do so until June. It won’t manufacture its Tread treadmill machine for six weeks, beginning next month. And it doesn’t anticipate producing any Tread+ machines in fiscal 2022, according to the documents. Peloton had previously halted Tread+ production after a safety recall last year.  
&gt;

Some highlights, with my added emphasis: 

""In a bubble, **no one wants to hear the bear case**. It is the worst kind of party-pooping. For bubbles, **especially superbubbles where we are now**, are often the most exhilarating financial experiences of a lifetime."" 

""The final feature of the great superbubbles has been **a sustained narrowing of the market and unique underperformance of speculative stocks**, many of which fall as the blue chip market rises. **This occurred in 1929, in 2000, and it is occurring now**. A plausible reason for this effect would be that experienced professionals who know that the market is dangerously overpriced yet feel for commercial reasons they must keep dancing prefer at least to dance off the cliff with safer stocks. This is why **at the end of the great bubbles it seems as if the confidence termites attack the most speculative and vulnerable first and work their way up, sometimes quite slowly, to the blue chips**.""

But now, for the first time in the U.S. **we have simultaneous bubbles across all major asset classes**. To detail:

First, we are indeed participating in the broadest and most extreme global real estate bubble in history. Today **houses in the U.S. are at the highest multiple of family income ever, after a record 20% gain last year, ahead even of the disastrous housing bubble of 2006**. But although the U.S. housing market is selling at a high multiple of family income, it is less, sometimes far less, than many other countries, e.g., Canada, Australia, the U.K., and especially China. (In China, real estate has played an unusually important and unique role in the extended boom and thereby poses an equally unique risk to the economy and hence the rest of the world if its real estate market loses air exactly as it appears to be doing as we sit.)

Second, we have the most exuberant, ecstatic, even crazy investor behavior in the history of the U.S. stock market. **The U.S. market today has, in my opinion, the greatest buy-in ever to the idea that stocks only go up, which is surely the real essence of a bubble**. (Interestingly, where other developed countries lead in housing prices, they lag the U.S. in equity prices. Some, such as Japan, by so much that they are merely slightly overpriced today.)

Third, as if this were not enough, **we also have the highest-priced bond markets in the U.S. and most other countries around the world, and the lowest rates, of course, that go with them, that human history has ever seen.**

What our financial leadership should know is that multiplying these risks – these three and a half bubbles – will multiply the total shock if the damage occurs simultaneously. And this package presents **more potential for writing down perceived wealth than at any previous time in history**."|investing|"Jeremy Grantham - ""Let the Wild Rumpus Begin"""|74.0|0.84

I'm a mostly long term investor holding a few big tech names, ETF's, and mutual funds. For context, I'm 26 years old and have roughly 40k in the market. My question is around cap gains and if it's worth selling peaks and rebuying valleys vs. just holding outright. 

For example, I took a big position in $APPL back in September when it was trading in the 140's. In the past few weeks the stock was flirting in the 180's. 

My question is, as a long term investor, is it at all worth considering selling my position at the supposed ""peak"", taking the short-term cap gains, and reinvesting on the next ""dip"" opportunity? Or, does it make more sense to just hold the position through market cycles given I have a long term investment horizon? 

The more I get in and out of positions, the more I'll owe in cap gains, which is why I'm unsure whether I'd actually make more in the long-run. That said, if I'm able to time a top and sell, I won't be ""losing"" money on the position throughout a downtrend and would then be able to reinvest my full capital back into the position once a reversal seems certain. Would the avoided losses be worth paying the short-term cap gains?

FWIW, I consider myself to be pretty knowledgeable about the markets and generally know when we're at tops and can expect a pullback based on market factors and TA. I work a desk job where I have my trading platform open daily to monitor the markets and my positions.

Finally, I know I won't always be able to perfectly time the markets and I'll miss out on continued uptrends from time to time.

Once touted as the biggest challenger to Starbucks’ dominance in China, Luckin was delisted from the Nasdaq exchange in June 2020 and six months later agreed to pay $180m to settle accounting fraud charges with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which claimed it had raised more than $864m from investors during the time of the falsified accounts.

According to two people with knowledge of discussions among the company’s senior management, Luckin is exploring whether to relist on Nasdaq, possibly as soon as the end of this year.

Luckin has held meetings with investors and advisers ahead of the proposed relisting, as well as to discuss other options for capital raising, according to the people. They said new management and recent growth at the coffee company could prove an attractive turnround prospect for investors.

A relisting would be likely to face fewer regulatory obstacles than a Chinese company pursuing an initial public offering in the US because its shares are still traded there and it has continued to file earnings reports, according to one of the people close to the situation.

Luckin filed for bankruptcy in the US in 2021 to allow it to restructure its debts while its coffee shops remained open. It could move ahead with the relisting plan once it concluded the bankruptcy process, one of the people said.

The fraud revelations were first published in early 2020 by short seller Muddy Waters, which accused the chain of having an “inherently flawed” business model and inflating sales.

But Luckin has since expanded in China. In December, it reported that third-quarter revenues had grown 106 per cent year on year to Rmb2,350.2m ($370m). It has 5,671 stores, the majority of which are on the Chinese mainland — about 500 more outlets than its closest rival, Starbucks.

Shares in Luckin have continued to trade over-the-counter in the US since it was delisted, giving the company a market valuation of about $2.5bn.

“We are seeing strong performance across the business . . . with increased customer retention and order frequency [and] greater brand recognition,” said Jinyi Guo, chair and chief executive of Luckin, in its latest earnings report.

Some longtime critics of the company continue to express scepticism, however. “Revenues rising sharply is something that those of us who have been following Luckin have seen before,” said Michael Norris, an analyst at Shanghai-based consultancy AgencyChina, who wrote a series of articles questioning the pace of the company’s expansion ahead of its IPO in 2019.

Luckin has restructured a large chunk of its debt, paid down a big portion of its SEC fine and appointed new auditors, according to company filings.

“They are doing financially and operationally very well . . . none of the allegations related to the quality of their coffee,” said one of the people close to Luckin.

“It’s an attractive asset because it has been doing so well in the consumer market,” the person said.

Shares that were previously controlled by Charles Lu, the co-founder and former chair who was voted out by shareholders in July 2020, totalling about 17 per cent of the company, are expected to be sold in the coming days, according to one person close to the matter.

Luckin declined to comment.

The group appointed Hong Kong accounting firm Centurion ZD CPA as its auditor last April after its previous auditor, New York-based Marcum Bernstein &amp; Pinchuk, resigned from the role stating it had “not gathered sufficient independent third-party data or conducted sufficient audit procedures to complete the audit”. EY, which audited Luckin in the run-up to its IPO, was replaced after the scandal.

First and foremost is the obvious argument that the companies today are fundamentally different from the companies back then. During the 1999 cycle, companies with no profit, no revenue, and sometimes even no product were receiving massive valuations from going public in the stock market. All you had to do is have an idea and put dot com at the end of your name. 

Today, the growth companies look much different. Yes, there's similar froth in the crypto and NFT space, but by growth, I am referring to stocks such as Zoom, Docusign, Teladoc, Paypal etc. All of these companies have massive amounts of revenue with clear paths to profitability in the next 5 years. Some of them are already profitable today and are expanding heavily.

But beyond this, if you simply look at the state of the market and the numbers, it becomes clear that this is not the same. In the height of the technology bubble, the S&amp;P 500 P/E ratio was 29 with the 10 year yield bonds yielding close to 6-7%. The growth yield on the S&amp;P 500 stocks was close to 3%. Today, the S&amp;P 500 P/E ratio is at 21 with the 10 year yield bond at 1.8%. The growth yield on S&amp;P is closer to 5% today. 

In an environment where bonds are yielding one-third of what they were doing that period, it is not unusual for people to be moving over to equities in order to look for returns. This is especially true in a period when equity growth is already expecting to yield more. 

Now, this is not to say that we are not in a bubble. But I am certain, that we are no where near close to where we were back during the technology mania of 1999."|investing|Why this is not the tech bubble (1999-2000)|792.0|0.86

&gt;  
&gt;“If major economies slam on the brakes or  take a U-turn in their monetary policies, there would be serious  negative spillovers. They would present challenges to global economic  and financial stability, and developing countries would bear the brunt  of it,” said Xi, according to a transcript of his remarks on Monday.  
&gt;  
&gt;Of the major central banks, the Fed is expected to be the most  aggressive, with financial markets now pricing in four rate hikes, and  the U.S. central bank is concurrently expected to start reducing the  size of its nearly $9 trillion balance sheet.

&gt;  
&gt;Traditionally,  Fed officials brush off concerns about how their policies impact other  economies, saying they can only make monetary policy for the U.S.  economy.  
&gt;  
&gt;Xi has reason to be nervous about Fed tightening.

The government plans to legislate to address misleading cryptoasset promotions

Adverts will be brought into line with other financial advertising, ensuring they are fair and clear

New rules will increase consumer protection while encouraging innovation

Around 2.3 million people in the UK are now thought to own a cryptoasset with their popularity rising - but research suggests that understanding of what crypto actually is is declining, suggesting that some users may not fully understand what they are buying. This poses a risk that these products could be mis-sold.

The consultation response, published today, sets out the government’s plan to bring the promotion of cryptoassets within the scope of financial promotions legislation. This means the promotion of qualifying cryptoassets will be subject to FCA rules in line with the same high standards that other financial promotions such as stocks, shares, and insurance products are held to.

This will balance the desire to encourage innovation with the need to ensure that cryptoasset advertisements are fair, clear, and not misleading.

Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak said:
Cryptoassets can provide exciting new opportunities, offering people new ways to transact and invest – but it’s important that consumers are not being sold products with misleading claims.

We are ensuring consumers are protected, while also supporting innovation of the cryptoasset market.

The government is eager to support innovation in cryptoassets and recognises the potential benefits of certain products like stablecoins, such as providing a more efficient means of payment, and in 2018 the government launched the the Cryptoasset Taskforce, which continues to steer the UK’s regulatory response to the cryptoasset market.

However, research undertaken by the FCA highlighted the potential for misleading advertising of crypto products to cause consumer harm.

The Government’s decision to bring these types of advertisements into the scope of regulation will mitigate the risks of consumer harm, ensuring people have the appropriate information to make informed investment decisions.

This will be done via secondary legislation to amend the Financial Promotion Order, which sets out the investments and activities to which the financial promotion regime applies. Under the Financial Services and Markets act 2000, a business cannot promote a financial product unless they are authorised by the FCA or the PRA, or the content of the promotion is approved by a firm which is. Firms that wish to promote such investments and activities must comply with binding rules that financial promotions must be fair, clear, and not misleading.

This will provide the Financial Conduct Authority with the appropriate powers to regulate the market more effectively. The FCA will shortly be consulting on their proposed financial promotions rules that will apply to cryptoassets.

Further information
The government intends to put in place a suitable transitional period (approximately six months) from both the finalisation and publication of the proposed Financial Promotion Order regime and the complementary FCA rules

The legislation will be brought forward once parliamentary time allows.

Today’s announcement complements broader proposals on cryptoassets and stablecoins set out via the government’s consultation on a regulatory framework for stablecoins last year, with next steps due to be announced in due course

1642458224.0|0.0|t3_s6gs28|75.0|"With the indices looking increasingly shaky and a further 10-15%+ SPY/QQQ downturn on the cards, I have been looking for sectors that are likely to outperform in 2022 to try and find some upside through the turbulence of the coming rate hikes.

With oil at almost $85 per barrel, up 10% YTD already and showing no sign of slowing down; I find it highly likely that oil/energy stocks will continue their recent run of outperformance throughout 2022. I have seen several posts over the last week requesting tickers in this sector to start some DD on, so I thought I would do a very brief overview of my one stock pick that I believe will net investors significant gains over the next 2-3 months and a potential 10-15x over the next 2 years - $VTNR (Vertex Energy).

Disclaimer: I own shares and LEAPs of VTNR.

**Overview**

Vertex Energy is a refiner of alternative feedstocks and producer of motor oil netting the company roughly $150m in revenue yearly on average, but has struggled to convert much of this into profit in what is essentially a low-margin business – but this is not what investors are here for in VTNR.

The company announced a strategy change in May 2021 which sent the stock from $1.80 to highs of $14.32 (has now declined back to $5.12 following the decimation of all small caps over recent months – however, the stock has recently formed a base and started a strong uptrend). They are in the process of selling their legacy business of motor oil and recycling assets to Safety-Kleen systems for $140m – the sale is expected to close in the first half of 2022. Running alongside this is what investors are interested in - the purchase of a refinery in Mobile, Alabama from Shell for $75m which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2022.

**Mobile Refinery**

Once the acquisition of the Mobile refinery closes, Vertex plan to convert the existing hydrocracker to produce renewable diesel by the end of 2022. The refinery has capacity of 91,000 barrels of oil per day, with Vertex expecting 14,000 of these barrels per day to be renewable diesel by mid-2023.

Vertex expect to spend an additional $85m on the conversion of the hydrocracker, and expect to be producing renewable diesel at the refinery by Q3 2022. They will also enter into a multi-year offtake agreement with Shell and others for the oil and diesel produced at the refinery.

Here is what Vertex’s VP of business development had to say on the offtake agreements.

""As part of this transaction, we plan to enter into multi-year crude supply and product offtake  agreements with several highly-respected counterparties, including Shell, who has been an   exceptional partner throughout the sale process. We believe these agreements will position us  to reduce our working capital requirements, while mitigating spot market risk on product sales.  Upon closing, we expect to hedge a significant portion of the first-year production, reducing our  near-term exposure to movements in refined product margins, as we focus on completing the  planned asset conversion, which remains the most significant near-term economic driver   resulting from this transaction.""

The share price dropped from its highs initially due to worries that Vertex would be unable to secure the funding required to buy the refinery and upgrade the hydrocracker. Those worries have been put to bed recently as Vertex have secured financing in the form of a combination of funds to be received from the sale of the legacy business along with convertible notes due 2027 and a credit facility. Investors should note that the convertible notes will likely be dilutive, though not in the short-term and I estimate maximum dilution around the 10% mark.

**Financial Projections**

In their recent Q3 2021 earnings call, management set out full year 2022 and 2023 forecasts for the refinery.

FY2022

* Revenue: $2.5 billion
* Gross profit: $240 million

FY2023

* Revenue: $3.5 billion
* Gross profit: $470 million

These figures were based on oil at $72 per barrel, and oil is up over 15% since then, with Goldman analysts expecting oil to top $100 in 2022 and JP Morgan analysts seeing it go even higher to $125 ($125 unlikely IMO unless Russia invade Ukraine). To put into context why I think Vertex will see massive gains in 2022, the current market cap is only $324m (share price $5.12) at the time of writing, or less than 0.1x 2023E revenue. 

|Oil Price $|60|72|85|100|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2023E Earnings $|180|220|250|300|
|Multiple|15|15|15|15|
|Market Cap $|2.7B|3.3B|3.75B|4.5B|
|Price per Share $|43|52|61|71|

(Assumes earnings is equal to 50% of gross profit in line with Wainwright’s analyst report, ignored debt and potential dilution (not near term) from convertible notes (likely 5-10%) for ease of calculation, used P/E ratio of 15 – current oil &amp; gas refining average P/E is 37, oil &amp; gas production average P/E is 20 and oil &amp; gas midstream average P/E is 18 per finviz).

**Short-Term Outlook**

The factor that could move the share price violently upwards over the immediate short-term is that a whopping 25% of the small 42m float is sold short with the closing of the purchase of the Mobile refinery expected within the next 2 and a half months.

Vertex will likely have their earnings update during the second week of February where I expect management to provide an update on the acquisition or to announce the deal has closed successfully, at which point I expect the stock to 2x or more. A double over the next few weeks would still put the stock at less than 0.2x 2023E revenue.

**Risks**

If the refinery purchase falls through the stock likely falls into the $2-3 range. I find this highly unlikely (less than 5% chance); Vertex has been hiring for new positions at the Alabama refinery of the last week and they have already started with initial design and engineering work at the refinery, indicating to me that the deal close is imminent.

Also, there is certainly execution risk following the closing of the transaction, particularly relating to the upgrading of the hydrocracker. Personally, for swing traders who are interested in a quick swing focused on the closing of the refinery purchase and likely subsequent short squeeze, I see relatively little risk. For those seeking larger gains in the hopes that management can execute on their earnings forecasts, they are definitely subject to a lot more risk. Size accordingly.

This has been a very brief introduction to the company and if anyone wants to do some further DD, Vertex has released some very detailed updates on their strategy pivot here:

However, since September 2021, I have put some money aside. To date, I have about $7,000 invested. My portfolio structure is as follows:

* 44% in stocks
* 33% in crypto
* 13% in a fund that is 95% stocks and 5% bonds (which I can only take out when I retire or want to buy property)
* 5% in leveraged CFD trading
* 5% cash

To date, I am not happy with the allocation of my money. I absolutely despise crypto at the moment and am looking for an exit point. I would have to sell with losses (although only around $200).

I have now decided to restructure my entire portfolio. I actually want to set a goal and build a portfolio based on rational thought and valuable data.

I listened to a podcast that inspired me to restructure my portfolio as follows:

**40% Base**

* 25% in ETFs
* 5% in Bond-ETFs
* 10% cash

**60% Boost**

* 35% stocks
* 5% options
* 15% crypto
* 5% CFDs

My main goal is to structure it so that I have less of a headache, but I still want to take some risk because I think I have enough time to balance it out since I'm still young and my career is just beginning.

I guess my question for the thread I'm anticipating here is whether I'm making the right decision, based on your thinking, and whether I should be less risk averse. I think a lot of my headache comes from current market conditions, which can change at any time (for better or worse).

1642411626.0|0.0|t3_s5zzqo|180.0|"Shares in consumer goods giant Unilever have fallen after it defended its £50bn takeover approach for the consumer healthcare arm of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), describing the business as a ""strong strategic fit"".

The group, whose products range from Domestos bleach and Dove soap to Marmite and Hellman's mayonnaise, said the GSK deal would help it beef up its presence in key sectors as it seeks to refocus on stronger growth areas.

GSK disclosed over the weekend that it had spurned a series of offers from Unilever towards the end of last year for the arm of its business that includes Aquafresh toothpaste and Panadol""

It said the offers ""fundamentally undervalued"" the business - in which US drugs giant Pfizer holds a 32% stake - and its prospects.

But reports suggest Unilever could try to sweeten the deal and in a statement to investors it showed little sign that its enthusiasm for the takeover had waned.

It said a deal would add GSK's brands in oral care and vitamins, minerals and supplements to its own presence in those sectors and ""create scale and a growth platform for the combined portfolio in the US, China and India, with further opportunities in other emerging markets"".

Investors were unimpressed, sending Unilever's shares 6% lower in early trading on Monday, while GSK added 5%.

Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor, said: ""It looks as ugh a deal is very much still on the cards despite GSK rejecting three offers including the latest £50bn offer""

""Unilever will have to raise its bid to somewhere around £55bn and move fast in order to avoid a bidding war from rival private equity buyers who are likely to be eyeing up counter offers.""

Unilever has been targeting a refocused strategy after a corporate makeover which ended its Anglo-Dutch dual structure in 2020, making it a single London-based group, Unilever plc.

That concluded that it should expand its presence in health, beauty and hygiene, which offer higher rates of growth, while spinning off lower growth businesses.

It has already agreed deals to sell its tea business, including PG Tips and Brooke Bond, and its spreads brands including Flora.

In its update on the GSK approach, Unilever said that it was preparing to announce ""a major initiative to enhance our performance"" later this month.

""After a comprehensive review of our organisation structure, we intend to move away from our existing matrix to an operating model that will drive greater agility, improve category focus, and strengthen agility,"" the company said.

The takeover offer comes amid plans for a spin-off of GSK's consumer healthcare business, led by former Tesco boss Sir Dave Lewis, later this year.

That would see the division, which notched up more than £10bn in sales in 2020, listed as a separate company on the London stock exchange.

But according to this net worth by age calculator, only 20% of people in their 60's in the US are millionaires in terms of net worth. https://dqydj.com/net-worth-by-age-calculator-united-states/

**I'm certainly not saying that everyone is in a position to add 10k per year to an investment account**, but I'd have thought that more than 20% of the population would be in a position to do that. **Plus this is a net worth calculator that counts home equity, meaning home value is included in the estimate for home owners**

So what's going on here? Are more people living paycheck to paycheck than I realize? Are people just really not that good at saving much?


**EDIT:** here are some more conservative numbers. If you start at age 30 (rather than 25) and save 5k per year, with a fairly conservative estimate of 5% returns per year which arguably accounts for a few % of inflation each year, you'd have 350k by age 60 and 634k by age 70, which according to the calculator linked above is a lot closer to the median percentile (60-70 percentile in this case)

**EDIT 2:** For any latecomers to this thread, some people have preferred numbers like investing 1k a year for 35 years at 10% return from age 30 to 65. This would put someone right at the 52 percentile and yield them around 300k by age 65 (or closer to 500k by age 70). So this seems to be about what the average person has pulled off.

However, it seems that many of these problems are non-issue if you could buy bonds with variable rates in stead of a fixed rate set at the time of purchase. 

Is it possible to buy bonds that adjusts its payment to the current interest rates? In that a rising rate environment would be bullish.

I thought I would share some of my thoughts regarding the tension between value investing and software businesses. Would love some of your comments and feedback on this to see if you agree / disagree with particular parts.

\---

Value investing is a form of allocating capital based on the principle of identifying good businesses that are trading below their “fair” or “intrinsic” value. Often, they are companies that are trading at a discount relative to their assets, the strength of their earnings or the steadiness of their cash flows. Value investing has proven to be a successful investment strategy, having made numerous millionaires and billionaires, including Warren Buffet.

However, the principles of value investing have been questioned over the past decade. Value stocks have performed terribly since the 2008 financial crisis, while growth stocks have performed exceptionally well during this period. Specifically, a large portion of overall market performance through the past decade has been captured by FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google) and other software-driven technology companies, which value investors have typically avoided due to high valuations. The post lockdown recovery has further highlighted the attractive returns provided by software-driven companies as several technology stocks are at all-time highs. That seems to be changing a bit with inflation, however the 10 year return metrics cannot be ignored. 

Value investing has gone through existential crises numerous times before and survived. I suspect it will overcome the current skepticism it is facing, as the core principles of value investing are still useful. However, as a prudent investor, I must continue to navigate changing market dynamics, question the principles of value investing and determine what, if anything, has changed.

**Devoured By Software**

Software has become a key part of our lives today. Yet understanding the full implications and potential of software-driven companies is difficult due to the varied levels of success these companies can have. Products can be category defining (Google Search) or useless (Apple Maps). For all their unpredictability, software-driven companies as a category still demand high valuations. As such, value investors have stayed away from the space and missed out on their returns over the past decade.

Marc Andreessen began exploring the implications of software-driven business in his 2011 essay [Why Software Is Eating The World](https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/). His essay serves as a great starting point for considering the following key questions of (1) whether the economic and business model changes of software justify the high valuations demanded by these firms and (2) whether the value investing framework is still effective in allocating capital in the markets today.

# An Expensive Opportunity.

There are three key characteristics of software-driven companies that could justify their expensive valuations: 1) Incremental marginal profits; 2) Scale and reach; and 3) Increasing return to scale.

**1) Incremental Marginal Profits:**

Software-driven businesses are characterized by high initial fixed costs. The R&amp;D costs required to get a product to market is massive. However, the incremental cost for each product sold is marginal. Profits can grow quickly once break-even is achieved, leading to a massive boost in profitability.

This is in contrast to traditional “physical” businesses where the ability to increase profits is limited by the variable costs and step costs of selling the product. While it might be impossible to predict which software products will take-off and what the magnitude of profitability growth will be, failure to understand the mechanics of software-driven business models makes software companies seem expensive.

**2) Scale &amp; Reach:**

A key distinction between software-driven businesses and physical businesses is the former’s ability to scale. Roughly 3.5 billion people in the world currently have access to smartphones and the internet ([source](https://www.statista.com/statistics/330695/number-of-smartphone-users-worldwide/)). A new product can reach millions, if not billions, of people faster than ever before and this trend is only accelerating with time. It took Instagram roughly 8 years to get to a billion active daily users; it will take TikTok roughly 3 ([source](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/instagram-statistics/) &amp; [source](https://wallaroomedia.com/blog/social-media/tiktok-statistics/)).

An important driver of the rapid growth of technology firms is the low cost of scaling software. Software-driven businesses are not hindered by the common limitations that constrain physical businesses (i.e. supply chain logistics, key real estate in major markets, physical resources and inputs, etc.), which increase costs and delay growth. Software-driven businesses can take advantage of Infrastructure-as-a-Service (i.e. Amazon Web Services) and other key services to reduce the cost of scaling. Gerald F. Davis, professor at the University of Michigan, has estimated that the cost of launching a start-up has decreased by a magnitude of 100x in the past decade ([source](https://bthechange.com/the-declining-cost-of-startup-companies-c5a9a72bf1e6)).

**3) Increase Return To Scale:**

A core heuristic of value investors has been the [law of diminishing returns](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lawofdiminishingmarginalreturn.asp) and [regression to the mean](https://theconversation.com/regression-to-the-mean-or-why-perfection-rarely-lasts-74694). Benjamin Graham, the godfather of value investing, summarized the notion best with the phrase: *“Many shall be restored that are now fallen and many shall fall that now are held in honor.”*

However, software has potentially increased the ability of firms to better fight these principles through network effects and increased returns to scale. W. Brian Arthur is credited for the modern description of the concept:

*Increasing returns are the tendency for that which is ahead to get further ahead, for that which loses advantage to lose further advantage. They are mechanisms of positive feedback that operate—within markets, businesses, and industries—to reinforce that which gains success or aggravate that which suffers loss…*

*More than causing products to become standards, increasing returns cause businesses to work differently, and they stand many of our notions of how business operates on their head.*

Software-driven businesses are often characterized by network effects and increasing returns to scale. As these businesses grow, their advantages become stronger, their probability of launching successful new products higher, and ability to scale them globally better.

Let’s use Google Search as an example. The more people use search, the better the product becomes. The better the product, the larger their competitive advantage, and the harder it is for a new entrant to compete. The better the product, the most people will continue to use Google Search instead of an alternative (do you know anyone who uses [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/)?) and the positive feedback loop will continue.

Contrast this to one of my favorite business that operates in the physical space, Lululemon. Every time I wear the Surge shorts, the product doesn’t become better. While there is an argument that the customer data Luluemon gains can improve their products, that iterative process is not as rapid, scalable and impactful as it is for software-driven firms.

# A New Paradigm?

The combined impact of these characteristics creates a fly-wheel effect where select software-driven businesses experience lottery like pay-offs. Traditional valuation approaches are not well-suited to understanding these low-probability-high-reward scenarios.

However, that doesn’t mean value investing is no longer useful. The principle idea behind value investing is to pay a price that is less than the “fair” or “intrinsic” value of an asset. The better you are at finding this gap between price and value, the larger your margin of safety and ability to make money. But some of the traditional heuristics and mental models associated with value investing need to be reconsidered.

Traditional valuation approaches considered risk to be a bug, not a feature. However, the three characteristics of software-driven companies described above incentivize software-driven firms to chase risky projects that have lottery-like payoffs. A [HBR article](https://hbr.org/2018/06/why-we-need-to-update-financial-reporting-for-the-digital-era) written by Professor Govindarajan, described how “*an idea with uncertain prospects but with at least some conceivable chance of reaching a billion dollars in revenue is considered far more valuable than a project with net present value of few hundred million dollars but no chance of massive upside*” to software-driven companies.

This is truer the larger the company is. If Apple considered a high probability of success project with a profit boost of $500m (which is significant by most standards), it would only lead to a 1% increase in their 2019 full-year net income of \~$55bn. They would likely pass in favor of something riskier but with more upside.

An alternative valuation framework is offered by CFOs of software-driven companies. These CFOs themselves admit that their market capitalizations cannot be justified based on traditional metrics. They speculate that perhaps their valuation might be the sum of the potential pay-offs of all the projects undertaken by their companies, now and in the future. This framework is closer to the venture capital world than traditional value investing. However, over-reliance on this approach would likely cause investors to be irrationally optimistic and over-value every single software-driven company.

How then do we reconcile the core principle of value investing and this new lens through which to view software-driven companies? I suspect the answer lies somewhere in the middle.

Investors would be foolish to violate the core principle of value investing. However, investors would be equally foolish in failing to recognize that the software business model has changed the incremental economics for select businesses. Perhaps the most prudent use of this framework is to understand that it applies infrequently, but when it does apply, it justifies the valuations. That takes judgement. And judgement is what separates investors from speculators.

Thanks for reading and would love your thoughts!

Bull thesis on Exelon Corporation $EXC

Last edited 1/13/22

TLDR at the bottom

Exelon is a Fortune 100 company that work​s in every stage of the energ​​​​y business: power generation, competitive energy sales, transmission and delivery with revenues of $33 billion​​. It is also the largest provider of carbon free energy having the largest nuclear fleet in the US. 

Recently Exelon’s share price has taken a hit due to unfavorable energy prices that have been surprised by a decade of cheap natural gas prices and a bloated balance sheet which is has significant liabilities coming due this year. 

https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/utilities/nasdaq-exc/exelon/news/does-exelon-nasdaqexc-have-a-healthy-balance-sheet-1

Exelon runs a number of healthy utility companies that focus of transmission and delivery energy that have had a number of favorable rate cases over the years. Exelon has however not managed it’s generation business well and recently decided to spin off Exelon Generation and it’s sales business Constellation to derisk its business and with it  dumping a lot of its debt (which currently sits with the generation assets) into a new company so it can focus solely on its regulated utility business. 

https://www.pottsmerc.com/2021/11/22/exelon-moving-nuclear-plants-to-spin-off-company/amp/


Exelon has released its separation from Exelon generation will happen Feb 1st naming the new board of directors and analyst day.

https://www.exeloncorp.com/newsroom/new-constellation-board-of-directors-named

Exelon’s remaining utility business that house seven regulated utilities in the Midwest and Northeast will use its $27 billion capital investment plan to support 7.5% annual rate base growth and 6% to 8% earnings growth.

https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnas/exc/quote

Corvex Management, an activist investor, estimated in October the company could be worth about $60 a share if it separates its assets. Exelon said in November it was conducting a review of its operations and that it had advisers to evaluate such a move.

https://www.bloombergquint.com/amp/business/exelon-plans-to-separate-power-generation-business-via-spinoff

Exelon also stands to benefit heavily from the build back better plan but taking advantage of its 11 billion dollars for reliability projects on the grid

https://www.eenews.net/articles/how-the-infrastructure-bill-could-change-doe-nuclear-grid/

Getting in EXC now gets you exposure to its spin-off company as well, as Exelon shareholders will get one share of Constellation for every three shares of EXC they own on Feb. 1, 2022

EXC price target recently updated to $68 in the near term

https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/22/01/24861999/analyst-ratings-for-exelon

TLDR 
Exelon share price is being depressed by its generation fleets debt and poor energy prices due to natural gas. Exelon is separating it’s regulated utility business away from its generation business which will remove a significant amount of debt from its balance sheet and derisk it business from volitive energy prices. There is a current investment opportunity to buy Exelon at its declined current price or purchase dirt cheap
Options and ride the upside wave after its separation on Feb 1.

And at what rate? Do you plan on reducing your margin amount as rates increase this year and if so, how/how much?

I.e. I’m currently borrowing about 47% of my portfolio’s value in margin (not including retirement accounts, which you can’t take margin out on). I plan to reduce this to about 25-30% by year-end depending on the speed of rate hikes.

It’s interesting to consider how high margin debt is (918.6 billion as of 11/30) as rates start increasing this year; is there any relatively recent empirical research exploring individual investors’/funds’ sensitivity to rate hikes in terms of margin? This could be an interesting start: [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-indicator-flashed-warnings-in-2000-and-2007-and-its-buzzing-now-11640865332](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-indicator-flashed-warnings-in-2000-and-2007-and-its-buzzing-now-11640865332)

Overall, margin is still only about 2.5% of the S&amp;P 500’s total market capitalization so I suppose nothing really alarming could stem from margin use itself, but I’m curious as to how others are adjusting their margin usage as rates increase

tl;dr Lots of margin usage, what does yours look like?

I know Peter Lynch has suggested using an RRR of **6%**, but that was probably written in a time when bond-rates were higher than today. **Presumably the RRR can be less than 6% today, as there are few investments alternatives to stocks that in todays economy give 6%.**

I also assume that RRR changes with time, depending on the changes of the risk-free interest rate (US 10 year bond rate).

General wisdom is that RRR when holding a stock should be much higher than the interest that companies pay on their debt, because you as a stock holder take on more risk than bond holders. Most stocks these days seems to be paying less than 1% interest on their debt, sometimes a lot less. 

So likely RRR is something above 1% and below 6%? 

A related question is: **how can you gauge the market average RRR in a simple way?** One idea I had was to look at the average dividend payout of US regional banks with little historic growth and little historic growth prospects. Presumably the main reason to own a stock like that is to get a dividend payout, and the market will bid up the price of these stocks until the dividend yield is below the RRR?

A quick [screen](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=161&amp;f=fa_epsyoy_u10,fa_sales5years_u5,sec_financial&amp;ft=2) for this idea, shows that most such banks pay out no more than 3% dividend.

\---

Hi there.

I am currently reading Graham's ""Intelligent Investor"" for the first time. Disclaimer: I am not done reading yet! So far it answers a lot of questions of mine as a newbie investor, but one keeps emerging due to the current situation:

If I understand correctly Graham proposes a 50:50 split between stocks and bonds for the defensive investor (with 25min 75max for each). I try to follow his wisdom and started searching for ""high grade bonds"". Being from Europe - the first thing that came into my mind was German Federal bonds - rock solid, so they must qualify as high grade.

Well, a 10y bond currently pays 0.0% interest and a buy-in now would equate to a slightly net negative investment. Wondering, who would actually buy into this, the only entities I could think of are institutional cash holders that would otherwise be charged heavy negative interests by their banks.

While I am aware that there are corporate bonds etc. - do they really qualify as high grade? since they come with a significant risk, do they not?

Now the questions arise: Am I missing something here? Are there bonds which qualify as high grade but pay a reasonable (read: close to inflation levels) interest? Or am I to take Grahams advice in the sense of ""do divide your portfolio into stocks and something uncorrelated and potentially independent of the stock market"" - in this case I would just leave money on my bank account at 0% interest - right?

When you invest in margin, the stock you intend to buy has a margin requirement and volatility level, how can you know how RH determines these things and when they may change? Is there an independent method to check to see if RH is behaving honestly and with merit with regards to these determinations? I am using RH now, but have noticed margin requirements change but not often. When I used etrade, I would buy stocks and the next day they would often change the margin requirements for various reasons. A stock changing from a determination of high volatility to medium and the margin buying power increasing is very bullish IMO, this is why I want to know.

I ask this question because I have recently went very heavy on SNDL and TLRY with plans to hold a long time and I'm certain the bottom has been bought. Once the volatility has been changed by RH, I expect to see a big increase in the stock price. I am grateful it wasn't allowed when I initially started buying however and it was a reason I chose this stock so heavy so I couldn't overinvest. Sub 60c, I do wish I could buy on margin. TLRY does allow margin and I have used it to buy 1000 shares. If they would reverse the call on volatility, I would most like have to sell some.

What do you think RH would say as to their justification? I have noticed they often don't update things and I think they don't care.

1641950844.0|0.0|t3_s1tja5|442.0|"I have a taxable brokerage and ROTH IRA with Fidelity.  A Fidelity advisor I met with recently suggested a two things that I am hoping to get some thoughts on.  

1) He said in a taxable account, generally an indexed ETF is more tax efficient than an equivalent indexed mutual fund.  His explanation was that generally the ETF has less distributions than the equivalent mutual fund as as a result you pay less taxes on the ETF's distributions compared to the equivalent mutual fund and reap greater compounded returns over time.  

2)  When it comes to the ROTH IRA, taxable distributions are no longer a concern (I agree)  so he suggested a handful of Fidelity 0% expense ratio mutual funds.  The reason being was that the 0% expense ratio is more beneficial compared to the ETF with a marginal expense ratio.  

I know  everyone has their favorite stocks, ETFs, and mutual funds so I am hoping you can weigh in on the merit of 1 and 2 before reading on the rest.  Point #1 seems legit enough and I have found some research online to substantiate it.  Point #2 is a little more suspect to me as I can understand 0% ER is better than something greater than 0% but I am not sure if he is just trying to peddle Fidelity funds that might not track an index exactly and might not perform as well.  

With all that said, he suggested a handful of iShare ETFs for the brokerage:  IVV (S&amp;P 500) , IJR (Small Cap) , IJH (Mid Cap) , and IVW (S&amp;P 500 Growth) (some simple research showed that these have lower expense ratios than SPY, QQQ, and some of the vanguard equivalents but just with less volume which I guess I am okay with except I was hoping to write some covered called on them from time to time)  

He suggested 3 each  0% Expense Ratio Mutual funds for the ROTH IRA:  FNILX (Large Cap Index) FZILX (International), FZIPX  (Extended Mid to Small Cap Market) 

Thanks for any thoughts or feedback!


Edit and Update:  

Thanks everyone for the overwhelming responses! Summarizing the responses for those just getting to this:   It sounds like for the most part the majority seem to agree that the advice in points 1 and 2 is sound.  Additionally there may be ""transaction fees"" associated with the 0% ER Mutual funds but there is not enough clarity on what those are with respect to other Mutual Funds and I should look at other factors like performance of the funds to make the best decision on if the 0% ER mutual funds are good for me. Finally, the advisor is likley a fiduciary meaning he should be advising in my best interest and that does not mean he can't recommend Fidelity funds and partner funds (iShares are  Blackrock product with an agreement with Fidelity) if he still feels they are best for me."|investing|0% Expense Ratio Mutual Funds Vs Indexed ETFs|442.0|0.94

TLDR: I have been following Huya for a while and I believe the stock is much undervalued at the moment, since 80%+ of the stock price is made of its net cash position. I believe that the only meaningful risk that could lower the price is the possible delisting, since the stock is listed on the NYSE. 

*Sources: Huya’s annual report, Huya’s stock prices and Huya’s press releases,* [*marketbeat.com*](https://marketbeat.com)

Huya is the leading live streaming platform in China, that is primarily focused on gaming and e-sports live streaming but has also extended its contents to talent shows, anime and outdoor activities.

Stock chart: [https://imgur.com/pIGlRTU](https://imgur.com/pIGlRTU) 

In July 2021 the company announced the termination of the merger agreement with DouYu (the second biggest live streaming platform in China) because of the intervention of the State Administration for Market Regulation. The reason was that Huya and DouYu together would have controlled more than 80% of the market based on active users.

The stock reached its peak in March 2021 (non-considering IPO prices), reaching 36.33$ before starting a steep downtrend, touching its all-time low at 6.08$ the 3rd of December 2021 also due to the strong short positions held on the stock, that reached approx. 30% of the Market Cap (Today’s market cap is around $ 1.7bn) before decreasing in the recent quarters.

Short Positions trend:  [https://imgur.com/qviqYzU](https://imgur.com/qviqYzU)

Taking into account the 9M21 results (unaudited) and $ 7.50 as Huya’s stock price the situation is as follow:  [https://imgur.com/zlxP0D9](https://imgur.com/zlxP0D9)

**Aggressive scenario**: we do consider Cash &amp; CE, Short Term investments (short-term wealth management products and money market funds with maturities of less than one year), Short term deposits (interest-bearing bank deposits) and financial liabilities (leases). It this scenario, Huya’s net cash position is worth $ 7.21 per share (96% of the current price)

**Base scenario**: we do consider Cash &amp; CE, Short Term deposits and financial liabilities (aka leases). It this scenario, Huya’s net cash position is worth $ 6.55 per share (87%% of the current price).

**Cautions scenario**: we do consider Cash &amp; CE, Short term deposits, short term investments, financial liabilities and operative debts (mostly made of revenue share fees to be paid to content creators). It this scenario, Huya’s net cash position is worth $ 6.06 per share (81% of the current price), that is the all time low reached by the stock.

That means that you are buying Huya’s brand, customer base, assets, softwares, and so on, **just for** 68 / 225 / 341 mn $ (**0.29 / 0.95 / 1.74 $ Per share**). **If the company goes bankrupt today, you are going to get almost the same amount of dollars you spend to buy it**.

My idea is that the stock was too hyped before because of the merger, and got really hurt by the government decision (it was the first time the Chinese competition authority stopped a deal). Moreover, a series of headwinds kept the trend bearish (delisting, chinese government against tech stock, see Alibaba, short positions built in the months before) for the rest of the year. At the moment, I don’t how is it possibile that the stock is worth the same amount of the cash the company has, expecting ZERO growth for the future for a company that is still growing (+30% FY20 vs FY19, 9M21 flat compared to 9M20 that were positively impacted by the pandemic) per year and that is profitable.

I have invested in Huya and I may be biased, that’s why I want you to tell me why I am wrong, the only headwind that I believe could push the stock lower than these prices is the delisting (Huya is listed on the NYSE), which I consider to be unlikely.

## Intel Drops A Bomb On The Robotaxi Industry

## Summary

* Despite  most investors focusing on Tesla for robotaxis, Intel’s Mobileye is  currently in volume production of its camera-only L2+ autonomous driving  SuperVision system, beating all competitors to the punch.
* Moreover,  Mobileye announced the world’s first L4 consumer vehicle, launching in  early 2024. Mobileye has a substantial technology and first-mover  advantage.
* If  Tesla bulls can attribute a $1T market cap to their company’s  non-existent robotaxis, then initiating Mobileye at a $1T price target  (representing 20x upside) seems reasonable.
* Mobileye could hence become one of the greatest investments of the coming decades.

## Investment Thesis

In a significant bit of news that likely went largely unnoticed by the investment community, not Tesla ([TSLA](https://archive.is/o/CUIAS/https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSLA?source=content_type:react|section:main_content|button:body_link)), Nvidia ([NVDA](https://archive.is/o/CUIAS/https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA?source=content_type:react|section:main_content|button:body_link)) or anyone else, but actually Intel ([INTC](https://archive.is/o/CUIAS/https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/INTC?source=content_type:react|section:main_content|button:body_link))  Mobileye achieved a major milestone in late 2021 by going into volume  production of its camera-only SuperVision autonomous driving system.  Combined with Mobileye's robotaxi business that will start operating in  two international cities in 2022 (based on a camera-based system  combined with a lidar and radar-system), this means autonomous driving  has finally gone from the lab to the fab, and is poised to contribute  billions or even trillions in value to the economy as the technology  gains scale in the coming years and decade(s).

In addition, perhaps the most significant news from CES this week was the [announcement](https://archive.is/o/CUIAS/https://www.mobileye.com/ces-2022/) of the world's first L4 consumer AV, slated for an early 2024 launch, yet again beating others such as Tesla to the punch.

As  such, Mobileye could become one of the new Big Tech companies as the  backbone of the 21st century autonomous transportation system. Hence, I  initiate Mobileye (which will IPO in mid-2022) at a $1T market cap  target, which could represent 20x upside from its suggested $50B IPO.

## Background

When  people talk about autonomous driving, there is one myth that is often  discussed: the need for compute (measured in TOPS). For that reason,  many investors have pointed to Nvidia as a beneficiary of autonomous  driving. For example, NIO ([NIO](https://archive.is/o/CUIAS/https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NIO?source=content_type:react|section:main_content|button:body_link))  uses 4x Nvidia Orin SoCs in its upcoming ET7 NIO Autonomous Driving  System, for a grand total of 1 POPS (1000 TOPS), combined with over 30  sensors including lidar.

I provide this comparison to give the  reader an impression of just how impressive Mobileye's approach is:  Mobileye's SuperVision, which has gone into production in late 2021 in  the Geely Zeekr 001, leverages just two EyeQ5 SoCs for a grand total of  30 TOPS. Nevertheless, despite having over 30x less compute resources,  Mobileye achieves pretty much exactly the same (or even more advanced)  capabilities as any other car currently in production. Mobileye's system  also uses about 3x less sensors since, similar to Tesla, SuperVision is  completely camera-only (using seven cameras and four parking cameras).

To  be specific, the SuperVision allows for completely hands-free driving  (like a robotaxi or ""full self-driving""). (The reason the system is  nevertheless classified as L2+ is because it isn't validated for the  safety requirements for L4.)

In other words, it really matters  what one does with the compute resources available (the software), and  Mobileye has proven for years that it can do more with less. What this  means is simply that Mobileye's software is much smarter since it can  more effectively make use of the available compute. Mobileye's CTO has  recently [provided a deep dive into the SuperVision system](https://archive.is/o/CUIAS/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGL0z1BULs),  which is worth watching to see the system in action in cities like  Paris and New York City. Note that no other company in the world has  been testing its autonomous driving system in as many locations as  Mobileye, another testament and proof point of Mobileye's ability to  scale its system, which I further detailed previously: [Waymo May Be Disrupted By Its Inability To Scale (NASDAQ:](https://archive.is/o/CUIAS/https://seekingalpha.com/article/4432226-waymo-may-be-disrupted-by-its-inability-to-scale?source=content_type:react|section:main_content|button:body_link)[GOOG](https://archive.is/o/CUIAS/https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG?source=content_type:react|section:main_content|button:body_link)).

## Consumer AVs

SuperVision  is still just a L2+ system: despite being fully capable of autonomous  driving, it has not been validated for the reliability requirements for  the ""holy grail"" L4. So admittedly, it will still take a few years for  autonomous driving to become a reality for consumer: Mobileye is  targeting 2024.

In its L4 system, in order to reach the required  reliability, Mobileye will combine the camera-only SuperVision system  with a second system based on lidar and radar (similar to its approach  in robotaxis). Mobileye has even suggested perhaps there could even be  three subsystems if the lidar and radar are further split into separate  systems, which will become possible due to Mobileye's in-house lidar  (based on Intel's industry-leading silicon photonics) and innovative  high-resolution in-house software-defined radar. Mobileye especially  sees the high-res radar as promising to reduce the cost for affordable  AVs since radar is inherently 5-10x less expensive than lidar.

So  although it could be debated if and to what extent the recent  SuperVision system counts as ""full self-driving"", it nevertheless serves  as a first proof point that autonomous driving has finally gone from  something that perpetually seems five years away, to a tangible  commercial reality.

In any case, Mobileye's grand [announcement](https://archive.is/o/CUIAS/https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/zeekr-mobileye-working-together.html%23gs.ld0ya8)  at CES was its very first L4 design win with Geely Zeekr, slated for  early 2024. This system will be based on 8x EyeQ5 SoCs (or about 120  TOPS).

Mobileye further [announced its next-gen SoC](https://archive.is/o/CUIAS/https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/mobileye-ces-2022-tech-news.html%23gs.kr10jb)  for widespread adoption of AVs starting in 2025. The EyeQ Ultra is  touted as Mobileye's AV-on-a-Chip, providing all compute resources in a  single chip. It is one of the most heterogenous chips ever created,  containing CPUs, GPUs, NPUs, FPGAs, VPUs and more.

&gt;At  a mere 176 TOPS, the EyeQ Ultra is much more efficient than other AV  solutions, delivering the necessary performance and price-point required  for consumer-level AVs.

## Robotaxis

In  addition to extending its current industry-leading position in ADAS into  AVs, Mobileye saw several years ago that autonomous driving would first  start with robotaxis, and has likewise been investing to lead this new  industry (as evidenced by the [2020 Moovit acquisition](https://archive.is/o/CUIAS/https://seekingalpha.com/article/4346405-intel-distances-from-autonomous-vehicle-competition-1-billion-acquisition?source=content_type:react|section:main_content|button:body_link)  for example). Mobileye has been testing its robotaxis for many years in  Israel, expanded its testing to Munich/Germany in late 2020, and  further expended testing to many other cities in 2021, including in  Detroit, Paris, Asia, Tokyo and New York City.

This will  culminate in the initial robotaxi launch in Tel Aviv and Munich in  mid-2022, which is on schedule to what Mobileye has been saying since  2018 (!). This can't be emphasized enough since in the same time frame,  virtually all of Mobileye's competitors including Google ([GOOG](https://archive.is/o/CUIAS/https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG?source=content_type:react|section:main_content|button:body_link)) ([GOOGL](https://archive.is/o/CUIAS/https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL?source=content_type:react|section:main_content|button:body_link)) Waymo, Tesla and GM ([GM](https://archive.is/o/CUIAS/https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GM?source=content_type:react|section:main_content|button:body_link))  Cruise have seen delays to their programs. Mobileye is on track to what  it said four years ago, and is targeting an international rollout from  the start (made possible due to Mobileye's unique global mapping  approach as opposed to the legacy geofenced approach).

## ADAS

Mobileye also [announced](https://archive.is/o/CUIAS/https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/mobileye-ces-2022-partner-news.html%23gs.ld14rg) several extended ADAS partnerships at CES, including ones to bring its REM mapping for lane-centering ADAS to Volkswagen ([OTCPK:VWAGY](https://archive.is/o/CUIAS/https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VWAGY?source=content_type:react|section:main_content|button:body_link)) and Ford ([F](https://archive.is/o/CUIAS/https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/F?source=content_type:react|section:main_content|button:body_link)).

Mobileye  further announced that it had achieved 41 design wins totalling 50M  units in 2021. For comparison, Mobileye shipped its 100 millionth EyeQ  in late 2021.

## 200PB of data

One oft-heard argument is that supposedly only Tesla has the data and has the Dojo supercomputers. This is false, as [Intel detailed](https://archive.is/o/CUIAS/https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/mobileye-ces-2022-self-driving-secret-data.html?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;CID=iosm&amp;icid=100002810424702%257Calways-on&amp;linkId=100000101282322%23gs.lg2vve) Mobileye has 200PB of data and 500k CPU cores:

&gt;Mobileye  has spent 25 years collecting and analyzing what we believe to be the  industry's leading database of real-world and simulated driving  experience

## Valuation

Given Mobileye's  nearly flawless execution to its comprehensive vision and strategy,  Mobileye is quickly establishing a tangible leadership position in both  robotaxis and consumer AVs. As such, I would argue that Mobileye  deserves a premium valuation as one of the upcoming new Big Tech  companies.

As such, the sky is the limit. For example, Tesla  investors for years have attributed trillion-dollar valuations to the  company based on the promised (but never delivered) 1 million robotaxis  in 2020. Clearly, not Tesla but Mobileye is now making this premise a  reality.

Investors should note that robotaxis are inherently  poised to be very profitable since they remove virtually all opex costs,  by removing many thousands (if not millions) of drivers from the  (transportation) economy. This will make robotaxis both cheaper and more  profitable than legacy ride-hailing services like Uber ([UBER](https://archive.is/o/CUIAS/https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UBER?source=content_type:react|section:main_content|button:body_link)), Lyft ([LYFT](https://archive.is/o/CUIAS/https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LYFT?source=content_type:react|section:main_content|button:body_link)) and DiDi ([DIDI](https://archive.is/o/CUIAS/https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DIDI?source=content_type:react|section:main_content|button:body_link)).

As  such, there is indeed no reason why Mobileye shouldn't be able to  aspire to this $1 trillion market cap target, which is indeed the target  I initiate Mobileye coverage at.

## Risks

Given Mobileye's  progress on the technology side, which as detailed is now being  translated into numerous commercial deals, the main risk now is  regulation. However, Mobileye has already [said](https://archive.is/o/CUIAS/https://www.timesofisrael.com/mobileye-to-launch-autonomous-taxi-pilot-in-tel-aviv-munich-in-2022/) it is on track to operate its robotaxis in Germany and Israel without safety driver by the end of 2022.

## Investor Takeaway

Although  the Geely Zeekr 001 launch with Mobileye's camera-only autonomous  driving system went largely unnoticed, it represents a significant first  milestone towards the ultimate blue sky vision of an economy based on  driverless transportation, freeing up potentially many millions of jobs.  The value this creates will be immense, and hence Mobileye, as the  leader in driving this revolution, should be valued exactly as such.

The  next milestone is slated in the next few months already with the start  of Mobileye's international robotaxi business. The next milestone after  that will be the completion of Intel's in-house lidar and radar, which  will bring the cost down to levels suitable for mass production in  consumer vehicles. This is targeted for early 2024 (also in partnership  with Geely Zeekr), and will likely be the world's first commercial L4  consumer AV.

Hence, autonomous driving is quickly becoming a  commercial (and profitable) reality, for which the mid-2022 Mobileye IPO  provides investors with potentially one of the best investments for the  coming decades.

Buffet: Invests in high quality companies with managements that he could trust. Would hold long-term.

Soros: Took advantage of ""disequilibriums"" within markets. He followed trends, but was cautious of things that could disrupt the investment thesis. He would then either sell or bet against the trend. Most of his bets were concentrated with various degrees of speculation.

Edit 2: Yes Tesla's P/S ratio below could be as low as ~18 if you annualized Q4 sales - although it's a bit weird to do that with sales being cyclical - but I didn't mean to dwell on the current valuation. The point of my post is to talk about longer-term roadblocks to the bull thesis.

Tesla is currently sitting on a P/S ratio nearly at 25.0 (using trailing year data). This is as compared to other mature industrial conglomerates that trade at P/S between 1.0-2.0 (ie Siemans, Northrup). This represents an extreme overstep in share price versus revenue growth: the share price in the last few years has vastly exceeded revenue growth, **meaning the stock has rewarded existing holders with an advance of future growth that has not yet happened**.

Note: I use P/S rather than P/E for comparison because it isn't fair to Tesla to look at their PE as they are heavily investing.

The bull case assumes Tesla will grow revenue into their valuation and even exceed all current expectations. In other words their revenue will increase and eventually when they reach maturity they'll trade at a similar P/S to peers (although possibly on the higher end of the range)

The bull case requires future Tesla revenues exceed 1400% total revenue growth on top of whatever S&amp;P growth is happening **just to keep up with expectations already factored into the share price**. Zero margin for error.

A large part of this revenue growth is expected to come from energy related businesses with $200-$300b+ generally cited by bulls..

What happens if markets/analysts at some point realize Tesla won't be able to grow at their prophesized 50-60% a year, but instead 20-40%? See Cisco circa 2000 for a lesson in what happens when growth expectations drop.

**I don't think Tesla is going to crash this year, not even next year**. Most money flows are short-minded, and investors will need proof of a deceleration. These catalysts will come, probably around 2024/2025...

**Electrifying the grid: the truth**

The biggest bull case for Tesla's valuation as ""not just a car company"" is a grossed up comparison of how much $$ the world currently spends today on coal/gas/oil, and then assuming Tesla will be able to take a large share of this market at high margins.

There's a reason I don't know a single utility analyst that is bullish on Tesla. It's important to understand how regulated utilities work. Utilities, unlike normal companies, do not get paid to sell product or services..instead they get paid indirectly for grid improvement &amp; maintenance.

The way this works:

* A utility first gets approval from their municipality for a project (ie replace a coal plant with wind/solar)
* The utility then generally borrows money via bond or equity issuance to pay for the project.
* The state sets an allowed rate of return the utility can earn on their asset base. If needed, they'll allow an increase in utility rates so that the utility can pay off that loan and earn a reasonable return on top.

Point #3 is the biggest impediment to electrification, and why it will take at least 30 years. Politicians are going to be unwilling to allow energy bills to raise fast enough to do this transition fast. Oh, and with regards to paying for materials, **utilities will go with whatever is cheap**. Cheap low-margin batteries, cheap low-margin solar. Tesla may command some early market dominance, but this is going to fade way to market forces. Utilities will be incentived to keep these costs down.

Unlike Tesla's car business, where folks are willing to pay a premium for a nice car, the battery/solar business has no moat. It's easy for competitors to come in and underbid, and they'll have many years to catch up.

Lets also talk a bit more about moat. Oil has plenty of it with Opec/Russia being run by literal mafias. How about natural gas? In the US - since fracking has become a thing - not so much. See ticker EQT, they are the number one natural gas producer in the US - more natgas production than Exxon - **yet their entire market cap is under $10 billion**. The market capture here isn't anywhere near what bulls are claiming.

**Scaling the company**

Lots of talk has been made as to the potential for Tesla to scale to become a ""giga company"" including into other businesses such as insurance, taxis, etc. Besides the fact that insurance &amp; taxis are low margin businesses and Tesla has no moat in the space, let's talk about scale...

Consider this for a moment. Tesla has currently about 70k employees, many of them highly motivated, and some of the best engineers on the planet.

* How many of those engineers will still be around in 2 years, 5 years? How many are going to retire (rich) once their stock vests (4 year vesting period)?
* How many more employees will Tesla need to hire to scale to a business that sells 10 million cars annual, insurance, taxis, energy? Even with automation we're talking about 100s of thousands of employees.
* What is Tesla? Is Elon Musk Tesla? Or the 70k employees? Will they need to lower the hiring bar as they scale up?
* If the first generation employees were the innovators, the second will have to pick up from the prior group and maintain the company. Will the second generation, third generation engineers be as motivated as the first generation that were able to partake in original share increase?

Purpose of the above is to help folks understand *the Tesla of 2030 will organizationally bear no resemblance to that of 2022*. Literally all the surviving dotcom companies that sit atop NASDAQ today struggled with this originally. Consider all the failed Google or Microsoft ventures.

For Tesla to become a $3 trillion dollar company, it can't be the Elon show. For reference though, **Tesla currently has the worst glassdoor reviews out of any company in the VTI top 10** (3.7/5.0), just barely below Amazon's 3.8 with 1+ million employees. This is despite the fact many Tesla employees have shared in the wealth thanks to stock grants. They are known to overwork their folks. This isn't a good sign for a company that still needs to scale at least 5-fold in hiring.

1641625835.0|0.0|t3_ryu2nb|1370.0|"A near-record number of tech stocks have plunged by some 50% in an echo of the dot-com crash.

Roughly four in every 10 companies on the Nasdaq Composite Index have seen their market values cut in half from their 52-week highs, while the majority of gauge members are mired in bear markets, according to Jason Goepfert, chief research officer at Sundial Capital Research.

“Whatever the fundamental and macro considerations, there is no doubt that investors have been selling first and trying to figure out the rest later,” Goepfert said in a note.

Another way of thinking about the tech wreck: At no other point since the bursting of the dot-com bubble have so many companies fallen like this while the index itself was so close to a peak.

“Valuations are at historical highs, companies are raising billions based on fairy dust, and the Fed is signaling a tightening cycle,” Goepfert said. “All of these are scaring investors that we’re on the cusp of a repeat of 1999-2000.”

Tech stocks have been under pressure since the start of the year amid a bond-market selloff that’s driven yields on 10-year Treasuries to 1.72%. The carnage worsened after minutes of the Federal Reserve’s last policy meeting — released on Wednesday — pointed to earlier and faster rate hikes, suggesting to some that the central bank became more hawkish quicker than many had expected. Traders were quick to unload tech shares, whose high valuations become harder to justify in a rising-rate environment.

All this could spell trouble for active managers with broad market exposures since so many stocks are off their recent highs.

1. Maxing out my ROTH each year
2. Slowly adding to an investment account I am building for retirement
3. Working on building my emergency fund along with extra for a down payment on a larger house.

So since I will get hit on fees id like to make this a one time thing haha.

&gt;Investors  have been preparing for the Federal Reserve to start hiking interest  rates. They also know the central bank is cutting the amount of bonds it  buys each month. On top of that, they figured, eventually, the tapering  would lead to a reduction in the nearly $9 trillion in assets the Fed  is holding.  
&gt;  
&gt;What they didn't expect were all three things happening at the same time.  
&gt;  
&gt;But [minutes from the Fed's December meeting](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/05/fed-minutes-december-2021.html), released Wednesday, indicated that may well be the case.  
&gt;  
&gt;The [meeting summary](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20211215.pdf)  showed members ready to not only start raising interest rates and  tapering bond buying, but also being prepared to engage in a high-level  conversations about reducing holdings of Treasurys and mortgage-backed  securities.  
&gt;  
&gt;While the moves are designed to fight inflation and as the jobs market heals, the jolt of a Fed triple threat of tightening [sent the market into a tailspin](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/04/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)  Wednesday. The result saw stocks give back their Santa Claus rally  gains and then some as the prospect of a hawkish central bank cast a  haze of uncertainty over the investing landscape.  
&gt;  
&gt;Markets [were mixed Thursday](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/05/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html) as investors tried to figure out the central bank's intentions.  
&gt;  
&gt;""The  reason the market had a knee-jerk reaction yesterday was it sounds like  the Fed is going to come fast and furious and take liquidity out of the  market,"" said Lindsey Bell, chief market strategist at Ally Financial.  ""If they do it in a steady and gradual manner, the market can perform  well in that environment. If they come fast and furious, then it's going  to be a different story.""  
&gt;  
&gt;Fed officials said during the meeting  that they remain data-dependent and will be sure to communicate their  intentions clearly to the public.  
&gt;  
&gt;Still, the prospect of a much  more aggressive Fed was cause for worry after nearly two years of the  most accommodative monetary policy in U.S. history.  
&gt;  
&gt;Bell  said investors are likely worrying too much about policy from officials  who have been clear that they don't want to do anything to slow the  recovery or to tank financial markets.  
&gt;  
&gt;""The Fed sounds like  they're going to be a lot quicker in action,"" she said. ""But the reality  is we don't honestly know how they're going to move and when they're  going to move. That's going to be determined over the next several  months.""  
&gt;  
&gt;Clues coming soon  
&gt;  
&gt;Indeed, the market won't have to wait long to hear where the Fed is headed.  
&gt;  
&gt;Multiple  Fed speakers already have weighed in over the past couple days, with  Governor Christopher Waller and Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari  taking a more aggressive tone. Meanwhile, San Francisco Fed President  Mary Daly said Thursday she thinks the start of balance sheet reduction  isn't necessarily imminent.  
&gt;  
&gt;Chairman [Jerome Powell](https://www.cnbc.com/jay-powell/)  will speak next week during his confirmation hearing, and a second time  this month following the Fed meeting on Jan. 25-26, when he may strike a  more dovish tone, said Michael Yoshikami, founder and chairman of  Destination Wealth Management.  
&gt;  
&gt;Stock picks and investing trends from CNBC Pro:  
&gt;  
&gt;One big factor Yoshikami sees is that while the Fed is [determined to fight inflation](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/14/wholesale-prices-measure-rises-9point6percent-in-november-from-a-year-ago-the-fastest-pace-on-record.html), it also will have to deal with the negative impact of the omicron variant.  
&gt;  
&gt;""I  expect the Fed to come out and say everything is based on the pandemic  blowing over. But if omicron really does continue to be a problem for  the next 30 or 45 days, it is going to impact the economy and might  cause us to delay raising rates,"" he said. ""I expect that commentary to  come out in the next 30 days.""  
&gt;  
&gt;Beyond that, there are some certainties about policy: The market knows, for instance, that the Fed starting in January [will be buying just $60 billion of bonds](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/15/fed-will-aggressively-dial-back-its-monthly-bond-buying-sees-three-rate-hikes-next-year.html) each month — half the level it had been purchasing just a few months ago.  
&gt;  
&gt;Fed  officials in December also had penciled in three  quarter-percentage-point rate hikes this year after previously  indicating just one, and markets are pricing in close to a 50-50 chance  of a fourth hike. Also, Powell had indicated that there was discussion  about balance sheet reduction at the meeting, though he seemed to play  down how deeply his colleagues delved into the topic.  
&gt;  
&gt;So what the  market doesn't know right now is how aggressive the Fed will be reducing  its balance sheet. It's an important issue for investors as central  bank liquidity has helped underpin markets during the Covid tumult.  
&gt;  
&gt;During the [last balance sheet unwind](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/20/fed-approves-october-reversal-of-historic-stimulus-leaves-rates-unchanged.html),  from 2017 until 2019, the Fed allowed a capped level of proceeds from  its bond portfolio to run off. The cap started at $10 billion each  month, then increased by $10 billion quarterly until they reached $50  billion. By the time the Fed had to retreat, it had run off just $600  billion from what had been a $4.5 trillion balance sheet.  
&gt;  
&gt;With the  balance sheet now approaching $9 trillion — $8.3 trillion of which is  comprised of the Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities the Fed has  been buying — the initial view from Wall Street is that the Fed could be  more aggressive this time.  
&gt;  
&gt;'Uncharted waters'  
&gt;  
&gt;Estimates  bandied about following Wednesday's news ranged from maximum caps of  $100 billion from JPMorgan Chase to $60 billion at Nomura. Fed officials  have not specified any numbers yet, with Kashkari earlier this week  only saying that he sees the end of the runoff still leaving the Fed  with a large balance sheet, probably bigger than before Covid.  
&gt;  
&gt;One  other possibility is that the Fed could sell assets outright, said  Michael Pearce, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics.  
&gt;  
&gt;There  would be multiple reasons for the central bank to do so, particularly  with long-dated interest rates so low, the Fed's bond profile being  relatively long in duration and the sheer size of the balance sheet —  almost twice what it was last time around.  
&gt;  
&gt;""While longer term  yields have rebounded in recent days, if they were to remain stubbornly  low and the Fed is faced with a rapidly flattening yield curve, we think  there would be a good case that the Fed should supplement its balance  sheet runoff with outright sales of longer-dated Treasury securities and  MBS,"" Pearce said in a note to clients.  
&gt;  
&gt;That leaves investors with a multitude of possibilities that could make navigating the 2022 landscape difficult.  
&gt;  
&gt;In  that last tightening cycle, the Fed waited from the first hike before  it started cutting the balance sheet. This time, policymakers seem  determined to get things moving more quickly.  
&gt;  
&gt;""Markets are  concerned that we've never seen the Federal Reserve both lift interest  rates off zero and reduce the size of its balance sheet at the same  time. There was a two-year gap between those two events in the last  cycle, so it is a valid concern. Our advice is to invest/trade very  carefully the next few days,"" DataTrek co-founder Nick Colas said in his  daily note Wednesday evening.

We've all noticed the market dip over the past few days and, knowing that money doesn't simply disappear from existance (fiat debt repayments aside), I'm trying to piece together where the money is going. 

First I saw that crypto was being slayed on all fronts. Then I saw that equities were also being slayed, but then I've also noticed that gold and silver too are dipping. Finally the 10 year note rates are increasing (suggesting a lack of interest in them).

Where else haven't I looked? What is spiking proportionally to the dip?

It's not inconceivable that the money (from selling) is simply being held in accounts, but I find that unlikely given its fiat, inflationary nature.

Perhaps the money has been used to pay off loans that themselves were simply printed into existence - thus the money would cease to exist (deflation). But I doubt this.

Your analysis suggests you should want to be bearish the S&amp;P500. You are pretty (\*\*extremely\*\*) sure it’s going down. Here is some information you might want to know before you take that bet.

In each 10-day period the $SPY historical probability of closing higher one day ten is 62%.

**But… the probability that it closes higher from time 0 in at least one of those days is 88.82%. Let’s dig deeper. (**Data source: [Tradewell](https://tradewell.app))

Chart: [https://imgur.com/a/5PoiFuO](https://imgur.com/a/5PoiFuO) (Source: Tradewell)

The chart above shows every single 10-day return period for the S&amp;P500 ETF, the $SPY, since its inception.

The blue lines show every single 10-day return period where the $SPY closed higher at least once.

The red lines show every single 10-day return period where the $SPY did \*not\* close higher at least once, ie. T\[0\] was the highest price the $SPY traded over the next 10 days.

If it’s not already obvious there are **a lot** bluer lines than there are red lines. In each of the charts shown below the red lines will depict price paths that did not close higher at least once.

The same applies on a 15 and 20 day-timeframes:

* \- In each 15-day period the $SPY historical probability of closing higher on day 15 is 64% and the probability that it closes higher from time 0 in at least one of those days is 91.53%.
* \- In each 20-day period the $SPY historical probability of closing higher on day 20 is 65% and the probability that it closes higher from time 0 in at least one of those days is 93%.

Chart: [https://imgur.com/gallery/u5asngT](https://imgur.com/gallery/u5asngT) (Source: Tradewell)

And how about in a 60-day period. Historically, 97% of the time the SPY has closed higher at least once over the next 60 trading days. \*\*Incredible\*\*.

Chart: [https://imgur.com/a/s5fwzZY](https://imgur.com/a/s5fwzZY) (Source: Tradewell)

So, what are the obvious and not-so obvious takeaways from this:

1. The S&amp;P500 has a natural upside drift on virtually every time frame the SPY has well over a 50% chance of closing higher than where it started.
2. The price path the SPY takes to its destination has a lot of new highs from the starting point. In each of the 10, 15, 20 and 60 day timeframes the $SPY has historically had a probability of closing higher at least once 89%, 92%, 93%, and 97% of the time respectively.

With the majority of stocks getting annihilated in Q4 (disregarding the majority of mega-cap, of course) and the Fed basically signaling they will be raising rates several times this year, with a starting target date around March I believe, I think now might be a good time to open some 6-month call options on stocks that have been beaten down in the Fintech space as well as some large-cap stocks sitting near critical support.  We have earnings season coming up starting in the next few weeks and running until March or so and the following stocks typically like to run during times like these.  

\*Fintech\*

UPST - 7/15 200C - Has taken a massive beating nearly 70% off highs.  They are trying to get into the auto loan business and have other potential catalysts (partnerships) around the corner.  Momentum stock that can run hard with Fintech coming back on the scene, especially at these low entry points with institutions that got out at the top.  Looking for entry around $110-120.

AFRM - 6/17 100C - Another one that has been sold off and shorted to oblivion hovering around $80 from highs at $160.  Have a feeling a reversal is coming soon and that this could ride on the shoulders of SQ, PYPL, COIN, etc.  Looking or an entry around $75.

\*Semis\*

NVDA - 6/17 280C - Trading in the range of 280-320 for the last couple of months.  Top growth stock on everyone's mind that has tons of potential catalysts and one that is going to be a leader in the Metaverse movement, which I believe as a whole will start to take off this year.  P/E and such are high but NVDA is solidifying its stance as a stock that retail and institutions just can't ignore.  No one doubts that this is an amazing company that will be a market leader, however, currently, it is a mega-cap momentum stock that is selling off and shorted due to a flat/downtrend in QQQ's.  NVDA is notorious for running hard into earnings and with a blowout quarter (which they typically have) and more price target upgrades, I can see this hitting 350 well before summer.  Looking for an entry around $250-260.

AMD - 6/17 150C - Similar ideas to NVDA with the semiconductors still running this year.  Chip shortage should begin easing in Q1/Q2 and with the Metaverse taking off as well as the upcoming acquisition of XLNX which has been pushed to Q1, I see AMD as being a leader in this space.  Volume has been hovering around 50M, and I anticipate it to increase with the above catalysts taking off and the QQQ's breaking out of their sideways trend.  Looking for an entry around $125-130.

From time to time, Warren Buffett often references various aspects of investing that he learned while under the wings of Graham. According to Buffett himself, the one analogy he found to be the most useful from Graham's book - ""The Intelligent Investor"" is the concept of Mr. Market. 

According to Graham, the stock market is a salesman that comes and offers you various quotes on the securities that you own. If he is feeling great that day, he might give you an amazing offer. If not, he might give you a lowball offer. The point is - you should never let the salesman's offer persuade you into thinking that your security is somehow more or less valuable. At the end of the day, the securities that you own have an intrinsic value and you should only do business with Mr. Market when it is favorable for you. 

From Benjamin Graham himself:

&gt; “The intelligent investor shouldn’t ignore Mr. Market entirely. Instead, you should do business with him- but only to the extent that it serves your interests.” 

In these turbulent times in the market, it is important to recognize that simply because the market is up or down doesn't mean that your company's intrinsic value somehow changed. It is simply what the salesman is offering you today. Instead, you should be looking deeper into your company's revenue growth, valuation multiples, and other fundamental factors and whether your thesis around that has changed. 

The mood of Mr. Market will often open up amazing opportunities in the equity market. In 10 years from now, we will be looking at many companies and saying ""wish we had bought it in 2022"". Don't let Mr. Market fool you.

This portfolio is designed to be long term.

Current portfolio is 55% IEF (7-10 yr Treasuries), 35% UPRO (3x S&amp;P), 10% SPY benchmarked to the S&amp;P 500. Essentially the portfolio is 115% S&amp;P and 55% IEF (I know UPRO gives 3x daily return so exposure is not always exactly 115%). This portfolio has performed well since 2009 beating the S&amp;P by 2-3% annually. However, that period was generally a period of falling interest rates so IEF performed well along with the S&amp;P. Regardless, I think IEF will still keep a low correlation with the market and give some diversification going forward with rising rates. Overall, this is obviously not a completely diversified portfolio and that's where I get a bit uncomfortable. I'd like to add international and small-mid cap exposure for diversification, however, it's tough when performance has been so good over the last few years (I know this will not continue forever).

A change I'm considering would be to lower the IEF and UPRO allocation and add an allocation to VEA (developed Int'l), IJH (mid caps), and IJR (small caps). Could look something like 20% UPRO, 20% SPY, 20% VEA, 10% IJH, 5% IJR, and 25% IEF (not exact, just throwing some numbers out there). The backtest on this does not look as good, however, I know that US large caps cannot stay in the lead forever and given this is a long term portfolio, this could be the better option moving forward.

For me, I'm fine matching the S&amp;P 500 returns long term even if they underperform other asset classes for certain time periods. This is another reason I am in the current portfolio.

The pressure Russia is putting on the Ukraine and the pressure China is putting on Taiwan are probably coordinated and mount a major challenge to American hegemony.

1641420170.0|0.0|t3_rwxyzn|40.0|"&gt;(Bloomberg Opinion) --  Once upon a time, Goldilocks saw inflation at 6.8% and knew the Federal  Reserve would have to act. Worried about the value of her home and  stock portfolio, she visited the Fed house. First, she saw Papa Fed Bear  who was big and scary. “We’re in a bubble. I’m going to cause asset  prices to crash, especially stock and real estate prices. Interest rates  and the cost of capital will soar, leading to bankruptcies and major  recession. Only after a major purge can healthy economic growth resume.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Next  Goldilocks met Baby Fed Bear, who was small and cute. “I won’t hurt  your portfolio Goldilocks. I’ll just do a little cosmetic tightening and  pull back at any sign of market unease or complaints from elected  officials. The main thing is not to disrupt the economic healing from  the pandemic.” But Goldilocks knew that was as scary as Papa Fed Bear. A  timid, politicized Fed in the 1970s managed to drag down the economy  without taming inflation, leading to stagflation and perverse government  policies like wage and price controls.  
&gt;  
&gt;Finally,  Goldilocks found Mama Fed Bear. She promised firm tightening to deflate  bubbles, clear out economic deadwood and limit inflation to 2%, while  keeping real economic growth at least positive for the next year and  setting the stage for years of robust growth afterward. “Let the  politicians yell and scream, let the markets beg for mercy, I will hold a  steady, independent course based on good data, firm theory and  battle-tested models.”  
&gt;  
&gt;I  don’t know which of the three Fed Bears will show up in 2022, but all  three are plausible enough that investors should diversify so none can  cause fatal financial damage. Just as important, decisions should not be  made on fairy tales but by sober consideration of the probabilities and  likely magnitudes of the three scenarios.  
&gt;  
&gt;The  median forecast for 2022 seems to be that the Fed ends asset purchases  early in 2022, and raises its target for the federal funds rate three  times, or by 0.75 percentage point. Since 1954, the real total return on  the S&amp;P 500 Index -- including dividends but after inflation -- has  been 3% in years when the fed funds target rate rises by 0.75  percentage point or more, versus 10% in other years. The chance of a 10%  real decline is 21% in those years and a Papa Fed Bear 20% decline  happens 8% of the time. Those are twice the 11% and 4% probabilities in  years when the Fed does not raise the fed funds rate by 0.75 percentage  point or more.   
&gt;  
&gt;While  a 3% average real return is not bad, for many investors it might not be  worth the 16% volatility and the doubled crash risk of Fed tightening  years. Moreover, 0.75 percentage point is only the median forecast, and  there’s a good chance the Fed will be forced into more aggressive action  with correspondingly larger effects on asset prices.  
&gt;  
&gt;Optimistic  investors are conditioned to think that poor market returns set the  stage for future growth. But if we look at the average annualized total  S&amp;P 500 returns for the five years after a year in which the Fed  tightens by 0.75 percentage point or more, they are somewhat worse —  5.4% annualized versus 6.7% — than five-year periods following years  without 0.75 percentage point or more tightening.  
&gt;  
&gt;What  about the Baby Fed Bear scenario? What if the inflation rate remains  above 6% for all 12 months of 2022? That’s just as bad for average stock  market returns as Fed increases of 0.75 percentage point or more — a 3%  average total real return for the S&amp;P 500. But despite the low  average returns, these years have sharply reduced volatility and crash  risk. Only 5% of the time is the S&amp;P 500 real total return worse  than minus 10%, versus 13% in other years — and only 0.4% of the time is  it a 20% or greater decline, versus 5% in other years. In the  subsequent five years, investors enjoy an average 9.1% annualized real  total return, versus 6.2% in other years. So, stock market investors  need not fear Baby Fed Bear, despite the painful experience of the  1970s.  
&gt;  
&gt;Averages  from the past are not predictions of the future. Their use is in  calibrating diversification. Your portfolio and financial plan should be  capable of withstanding the full range of historical events if they are  to have any hope of surviving what actually happens. Guessing the  future can produce above-average returns, but prudent investors plan for  being wrong as well as for being right.  
&gt;  
&gt;In  2022, median forecasts and historical averages identify Papa Fed Bear  as a major risk to asset prices. Expected real returns may be positive,  but they’re modest, and crash risks seem to be about double their  average level. Even five-year real return expectations seem reduced.  That’s not a reason to flee stocks and other assets, but it’s a reason  prepare for bad news and to be sure your allocations reflect your true  risk tolerance. If you can find cost-effective tail-risk hedges, they  may be more attractive than average.  
&gt;  
&gt;On  the other hand, most economists and commentators seem more concerned  about Baby Fed Bear. They may be correct from the standpoint of  long-term societal consequences, but the damage to investors would  likely be in below-average asset real returns, rather than in high  volatility or crash risk; and the five-year prospects would be quite  good.  
&gt;  
&gt;Of  course, we all hope for Mama Fed Bear to cure our inflation, bubble and  overleverage problems with a spoonful of sugar to help the medicine go  down. My guess is that’s unlikely without progress on fiscal issues—not  so much cutting spending and increasing taxes as moving from ideological  brinksmanship to rational budgeting with honest numbers.  
&gt;  
&gt;In  most versions of the fairy tale, Goldilocks runs away from all three  bears to the safety of her mother’s arms. She promises to be good and  give up housebreaking and stealing food from wild animals. But there’s  no running away from the three Fed Bears.

The transcript for the minutes can be found here -  [The Fed - Monetary Policy: (federalreserve.gov)](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20211215.htm)

If you read the minutes, there are discussions about Fed's balance sheet reduction and hints that interest rates may be raised sooner than initially believed by the market.

Excerpt from minutes "" Participants generally noted that, given their individual outlooks for the economy, the labor market, and inflation, it may become warranted to increase the federal funds rate sooner or at a faster pace than participants had earlier anticipated. Some participants also noted that it could be appropriate to begin to reduce the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet relatively soon after beginning to raise the federal funds rate. Some participants judged that a less accommodative future stance of policy would likely be warranted and that the Committee should convey a strong commitment to address elevated inflation pressures.

So the idea is the tool would allow you to define criteria for your index(market cap, industry, p/e and p/b, etc) and form it, then allow you to make adjustments as needed.

From there, the tool would keep track of how you portfolio deviates from the index, and what actions(buy/sell) are needed to track the index(or your version of the index).


This would address a number of issues with Index funds:

- Dividends would hit your account when they are paid, rather than quarterly from the ETF, allowing them to be reinvested sooner

- You can exclude companies you don't like, either for fundamental or moral reasons(ie maybe you want a high dividend index, but want to exclude Philip Morris because you don't want to profit off of tobacco).

- You can exercise tax loss harvesting by selling losing stocks, which isn't possible with an index

- Because you own the stock directly, you don't have to worry about a huge tax bill or time out of the market if the index fund decides to close down.

- Mutual funds and ETFs do not grant you voting rights to the shares they hold for you, but if you buy directly, you do have rights."|investing|"Would anyone be interested in a tool that lets you create a ""custom index""? Or does one exist?"|167.0|0.87

Thinking ahead to 2023, I’m envisioning a world where the backdoor and mega backdoor Roth options are gone. 

That leaves me with maxing my 401k which I do every year (full max not employer match), and then decisions on what to do with the rest. 

Presumably, I can’t invest in a traditional deductible or Roth IRA in any way. That means my only real options are a tax advantaged non deductible IRA and taxable brokerage. 

At that point, the non deductible option seems nonsensical. Partial growth with tax deferment seems appealing but I don’t like having to wait until 59.5 years of age for withdrawals and I especially don’t like the idea I’d likely be paying income tax on the gains. 

Alternatively the taxable brokerage offers a ton of flexibility both with withdrawals and long term capital gains taxes which will assuredly be lower than income. 

Given this, and envisioning a world without backdoor IRAs, is there any sensible reason for a high income earner to ever invest in a non deductible IRA over a taxable brokerage?"|investing|Is there any point to a non deductible IRA if the backdoor Roth IRA is eliminated for high income savers?|163.0|0.91

(It has been edited recently, but I've taken screenshots of its original promises).

Anyways, the value add of having all the info and data immediately available plus a person to help learn helped me justify the cost. 

Instead it was QQE Buy/Sell signals Rick stole from Trading View and rebranded, as well as the Awesome Oscillator. His lifetime member discord is just him calling out his stock trades and answering only the questions that lead to him making more money off the members, because the once free forex bots are now only free for the first 45 days, and hosted on FXPrimary, a forex site with loads of bad history. 

About a week after joining I was promptly banned for bringing up his obvious theft of signals from trading view. 

Apparently this kind of stuff isn't uncommon, although it's usually a $25/month discord fee for call outs. Many of which have the same win percent because they're based off of free TV signals.

I’m a 27 year old who just started contributing to a Roth IRA in March of 2021. I make enough to max out my Roth every year and save some on the side in an individual brokerage account (currently approx $12K in Roth and $7K in individual with consistent disbursements to individual account)

Up until now I’ve used my Roth to hold all of my long term assets and have used my individual brokerage account for my “swing” trading. I say “swing” because I trade individual companies based on trends and never hold any for more than a year, so I never take advantage of “long term” assets. 

Is it smart to invert this strategy and utilize the fact that Roth IRAs don’t get hit with taxes on every trade to swing trade in my Roth and use my individual brokerage account for my long term (ETFs and indexes) trades? Is there any downside besides not being able to utilize capital losses?

1641193602.0|0.0|t3_ruvpai|2.0|"I recently finished reading Out of the Crisis - byline ""The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education"", by W. Edwards Deming, originally published in 1982 but updated in '86.

For those who don't know, Deming was an American who brought Quality to Japan after WW2. Things often credited to the Japanese industry, such as the Toyota Production Model, just-in-time, etc., can be traced back to the conceptual seeds he planted in exchanges with leaders of Japanese industry in 1950. The American Society of Quality has a nice short biographical write-up on him.

Deming presents his common diseases of management - applicable to any manufacturing or service industry - with heavy emphasis on management responsibility. The reason for this is that management can only change the company's system, and the company's system is by far the overwhelming driver of employee productivity. He specifically quantifies (by experienced estimate) that ""most troubles and most possibilities for improvement add up to proportions something like this: 94% belong to the system (responsibility of management)\[,\] 6% special"" (ch. 11, ""Common Causes and Special Causes of Improvement. Stable System"").

This struck me being very similar to the argument against actively managed portfolios: take 100 active portfolio managers working for a decade, and some of them will beat indices primarily by luck; but the success of the best managers in this group will be erroneously attributed to their personal touch (""special cause""). When in reality, the reason for their success belongs primarily to the system (""common cause""). So the recognition of this myth of the active investor who by their own special touch consistently beats indices has rightly given rise to the popularity of index investing, and with it removed an inefficiency from a great many investment portfolios.

A fun illustration of common causes attributable to the system nevertheless being attributed to individual employees (either as accolades for high performance or admonishment for low performance), the book introduces the red bead experiment, a simulation that can be done with 10 volunteers. It's well illustrated by an industrial engineering professor in [this short YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geiC4UgpDyw).

What else really struck me was Deming's wealth of insights, quotes, and stores regarding the common diseases of management. As an index investor, as well as having worked in technical service industries, I both experience and see the effects of these diseases, and if my experience is any indicator, these diseases are likely a common cause across many companies that passive index funds invest in, which concerns me because this would then be a common weakness to an overall index portfolio. Here's but two of the deadly diseases, which ultimately represent inefficiencies leading to waste, increased costs, and lower profits:

&gt; 3. Evaluation of performance, merit rating, or annual review.
&gt; [...] It nourishes short-term performance, annihilates long term planning, builds fear, demolishes teamwork, nourishes rivalry and politics.

&gt; 5. Management by use only of visible figures, with little or no consideration of figures that are unknown or unknowable.
&gt; [...] Actually, the most important figures that one needs for management are unknown or unknowable (Lloyd S. Nelson, p. 20), but successful management must nevertheless take account of them. Examples: 1. The multiplying effect on sales that comes from a happy customer, and the opposite effect from an unhappy customer.

Finally, something to challenge this current notion that this period of relatively increased inflation will continue into the long-term. How much waste is embedded in the goods and services we buy? The good news here is that index investors stand to benefit from any gradual pan-industry reduction in waste (materials and person-hours). Deming argues against the common wisdom that cost and quality are zero-sum. Think of the often-quoted project management triangle: you can only pick two of: cost, quality, and time. Not necessarily always true! In reality, higher quality can drive down \*total\* cost. From the opening of Chapter 1:

&gt; Folklore has it in America that quality and production are incompatible: that you can not have both. A plant manager will usually tell you that it is either or. In his experience, if he pushes quality, he falls behind in production. If he pushes production, his quality suffers. This will be his experience when he knows not what quality is nor how to achieve it. A clear, concise answer came forth in a meeting with 22 production workers, all union representatives, in response to my question:
&gt; “Why is it that productivity increases as quality improves?”
&gt; Less rework.
&gt; There is no better answer. Another version often comes forth:
&gt; Not so much waste.
&gt; Quality to the production worker means that his performance satisfies him, provides to him pride of workmanship. Improvement of quality transfers waste of man-hours and of machine-time into the manufacture of good product and better service. The result is a chain reaction—lower costs, better competitive position, happier people on the job, jobs, and more jobs.

In conclusion, to be an index investor is to believe in the sustained growth and profitability over a long time horizon. I'm a believer in this because there is so much more room for improvement in the management of corporations. I am optimistic that this is gradually happening."|investing|W.

&gt;The statement to the stock exchange did not give a reason for the trading halt.

&gt;Evergrande has more than $300bn (£222bn) of debts and is scrambling to raise cash by selling assets and shares to repay suppliers and creditors.

&gt;Last week, the company dialled back plans to repay investors in its wealth management products.

&gt;Evergrande said on Friday that each investor in its wealth management product could expect to receive $1,257 each month as principal payment for three months irrespective of when the investment matures.

&gt;The company had earlier not mentioned any amount and had agreed to repay 10% of the investment by the end of the month when the product matures.

&gt;Evergrande said in a statement posted on the wealth unit's website that the situation was not ""ideal"" and that it would ""actively raise funds"", and update the repayment plan in late March, without giving further details.

&gt;The announcement was seen as highlighting the deepening cash squeeze at the struggling property developer.

&gt;Last week, Evergrande did not make some interest payments on its offshore bonds.

Tesla, to be fair, never really suffered the way many traditional automakers did. The EV-maker led by CEO Elon Musk found ways to keep vehicle deliveries at steady, record levels even as chip shortages caused some automakers to cut production goals.

Part of that, of course, comes because Tesla's overall volume -- while steadily growing -- remains much smaller than the higher-volume traditional automakers. But, it's a tribute to the company's innovation that it managed to grow despite a global chip shortage that impacted the entire auto industry.

EV rivals NIO and Lucid are in a much earlier phase of their journeys, but all three companies have major plans for 2022.

## What Will Tesla Do in 2022 (and Beyond) ?

In the coming year Tesla will expand its capacity as new factories come online. The EV leader now has four factories online -- Fremont, Shanghai, Austin, and Berlin. CFO Zach Kirkhorn laid out where the company stands and where it's going in his remarks during the company's[ Q3 earnings call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/10/21/tesla-tsla-q3-2021-earnings-call-transcript/) with investors.

""Over the last 12 months, we've done about 430,000 cars of production. And based upon everything that we know in the factory, where the bottlenecks are, what the potential is, we're targeting to increase that another 50%,"" he said. ""I think that will be a difficult goal but that's the goal that the internal team has, and they're going to continue to push on that.""

Tesla has ambitious plans to grow how many vehicles it can produce, according to its CFO.

""You know, we're trying to get to 5,000 cars a week as soon as we can,"" he said. ""And then we'll continue to push beyond that, potentially even getting to 10,000 cars per week at those factories. And then we'll add Cybertruck here in Austin and continue to grow from there. So, you know, our goal is to get to millions of cars per year over the next couple of years and then ultimately, in the long term, be able to achieve 20 million cars per year.""

## Lucid Looks to Ramp Up in 2022

Lucid delivered its first vehicles in the third quarter of 2021. The company plans to increase that in the coming year by closing out this one strong. The company has added 2.85 million square feet to its Arizona manufacturing plant. It plans to have 20 studios and service centers open by the end of this year.

""So you can see acceleration as a theme in the second half of 2021,"" CEO Peter Rawlinson said during the [Q3 earnings call](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4469784-lucid-group-inc-lcid-ceo-peter-rawlinson-on-q3-2021-results-earnings-call-transcript). ""We also continue to increase our service footprint across the U.S., not just with physical service centers but also with the roll-out of our mobile service program. We expect service centers to continue opening in North America and we anticipate hiring a significant number of additional service technicians as we expand our capabilities.""

Lucid plans to be able to sell more vehicles in 2022, Those goals include expanding beyond the U.S.

""Lucid continues to grow its operations in the U.S. but as part of our growth strategy, and more specifically, our international strategy, we intend to expand our sales, maintenance, repair services, and manufacturing activities outside of the U.S.,"" according to Rawlinson. "" ...On the retail and service front, we're looking to expand our footprint in Europe and the Middle East, and we expect to enter these markets in 2022.""

The company expects to sell 20,000 vehicles in 2022.

## Nio Has Big Plans for 2022

A Chinese EV company, NIO has [made some moves](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/tesla-rival-nio-reportedly-prepares-for-u-s-entry-ramps-up-hiring), including listing a number of jobs, that suggest it plans to enter the U.S. market in 2022. The company also said that it will enter Germany, Netherlands, Denmark, and Sweden in 2022, and reach 25 countries by 2025, at its annual Nio Day event.

Nio delivered 24,439 vehicles in the third quarter of 2021. That roughly doubled its total from the previous year. The company closed the year with over $7 billion on its balance sheet. It expects to deliver between ""23,500 and 25,500 vehicles, representing an increase of approximately 35.4% to 46.9% from the same quarter of 2020,"" the company said in its Q3 earnings report.

""Despite the continued supply chain volatilities, our teams and partners are working closely together to secure the supply and production for the fourth quarter of 2021,"" said CEO William Bin Li in the earnings report. ""Meanwhile, we are fully dedicated to accelerating our products and technologies development and bringing the three new products based on NIO Technology Platform 2.0 to users in 2022 to lead the smart EV transformation and adoption.""

This post is intended to spark a healthy discussion around using governmental student loans for investment purposes.

To give you some context. We are NOT talking about an American student loan but an European loan:

1) The interest rate will be 0,01%. Nowhere near the insane predatory rates of my American counterparts.
2) We are talking about max € 20k in loans i.e ~ 1000 euro loan per month for 2 years.
3) The repayment program will start two years after the lending stops or post graduation. The repayment per month is 0,45% of total debt per month. Which equals to 90 euros a months
4) You would be 4 years in the stock market before the repayment even starts. It will be meant for long term investing
5) Even if the loan will not be used directly for investment, you would still profit by putting it into a cash bank account with 0,4% interest rate. Therefore a person could wait for a sip the dip during a market crash and pay the monthlies with regular income. Or choose to pay it back entirely
6) The euro inflation of &gt;5,0% alone will eat away the debt.
7) This is not illegal in this country since this specific loan is not intended to pay for college tuition as an example. Ethical concerns is up for debate
8) you could call it leverage but it is no margin. Nobody will margin call if the investment drops in price. 

So you have two options. Either start investing directly and put the loan into an ETF. You may profit or not or just let it sit in your bank and decide to buy the dip or pay it bank instantly with no loss or profit."|investing|Investing borrowed money with 0,01% interest rate|0.0|0.5

According to Buffett, he believed that he is an intelligent investor because he has the patience to be inactive. While most managers and asset allocators are trading their winners because it has gone up a lot or because it has become too large of a portion of the fund, Buffett simply holds and lets his winners ride. 

The analogy that Buffett used was one from basketball. From Buffett: 

&gt; To suggest that this investor should sell off portions of his most successful investments simply because they have come to dominate his portfolio is akin to suggesting that the Bulls trade Michael Jordan because he has become so important to the team.

I'm here to make the counter argument that we're about to embark on another roaring '20s so buckle up buckaroo.

First off, this is not financial advice so do your own research and don't listen to random people on the internet. Second, I'm speaking about the US economy but the world's economy more or less follows the US economy so deal with it.

Now we got that out of the way, let's take a look back. The Great Recession 2007-2008 mainly brought on by over leveraging the housing market brought us quantitative easing and an opening of the flood gates of government spending. It took years to recover but we came out of it with very low interest rates, a heavy FED balance sheet, and little to no wage growth. The US was doing pretty well 2012-2015 so the FED slowly raised rates. Now when I say slowly, I mean 0.25% every quarter or so with heavy broadcasting of what is going to happen so the market didn't freak out. The market and overall economy shrugged off these increases and life was good. Trump came in 2016 and poured gasoline on an already smoldering fire with the business tax cuts so we were running hot. LFG!

Then comes COVID in 2020. Holy shit balls we're all going to die. The market crashed. Everyone stays home. Economy comes to a halt...for like a couple months. FED opened up its book of mischief and started printing money heavily, dropping interest rates, and the party started up again. The stock market recovered insanely quickly and the housing market exploded. What the hell happened.

It turns out, the US consumer has an insatiable appetite for buying shit. And we were stuck at home bored out of our minds just buying anything from baseball cards to canoes. And if there's one thing to get an economy flowing, its buying. We bought so much shit we ran out of shit to buy. Now we have supply chain difficulties in part from manufacturers shutting down during COVID, increased safety protocols due to covid, workers having to stay home due to exposure, and high demand for goods. We also have a growing sentiment of workers not wanting to put up with bullshit for low wages and demanding higher pay. SUDDENLY WE HAVE WAGE GROWTH. This is huge. More wages. More money to buy shit. LFG!

Now all of this led to inflation. IT'S NOT ONLY BECAUSE THE GOVERNENT IS PRINTING MONEY. The high demand, increased wages, and shortened supply all led to inflation. This is why the FED infamously said inflation was ""temporary"" and they got raked over the coals about it. Of course what time duration the FED meant is not clear so they walked back those statements.

Remember the gas shortage FUD and gas price inflation? Give me a break. It was a self-fulfilling prophecy by the media so people went out and bought more gas than they needed which was more than the supply chain could handle and prices increased. Of course it came back down but we forget things quickly.

Now we have a highly contagious omicron variant with lower hospitalization rates. We basically are given a gift to vaccinate all these mouth breathers which may be the best outcome. Supply chains will catch up and inflation WILL GO DOWN. The moment the consumer price index (CPI) numbers come back less than the previous quarter buckle up buckaroo because here we fucking go. Higher wages, high demand, and an open economy due majority of population (hopefully) having antibodies. Bring on these 0.25% rate hikes. This will only help inflation come down and the FED does a really good job broadcasting what they will be doing so the market is well prepared.

Finally, there's so much damn money out there. With low interest rates, there's no where to put it but the stock market, real estate, private equity, and to some extent crypto. Early stage companies are getting funded with some slideware and a nice smile. This is also why crypto has boomed in 2021. Money is readily available and it's looking for somewhere to go.

For someone who is looking to actively trade, would it make sense to hold the investment amount in these no expense ratio mutual funds? Holding the investable amount as cash in the brokerage account seems like a bad idea since it loses value due to inflation. Instead, investing in a zero expense index mutual fund would allow it to grow in the market, but also provide one the opportunity to sell the required amount to fund stock buying opportunities at a target value.

A breakdown of the process -

1. Invest $25,000 in FZILX and leave it to market forces.
2. 3 months from them, Musk tweets something stupid and causes TSLA to drop 15% in 1 week.
3. Since you believe TSLA is now at a lower price than what it actually needs to be, you sell $2000 worth of FZILX and invest in TSLA instead.

I.e. the losers keep dragging the ETF down and there are more losers than winners. Kind of the opposite of the safety diversification via ETF usually offers. 

Solar power is going to be huge, but most of today's solar companies will go belly up before then and the amount of profit the survivors can make from manufacturing installing solar panels are dubious.

So instead of trying to pick a winner there, I'm inclined to invest in manufacturers of solar panel and system components that will profit from a booming solar market no matter which solar company will go boom or bust (same rationale as going with TMO instead of picking individual biotech companies, see also the selling shovels in a gold rush analogy.)

I found [this site listing component manufacturers](https://www.enfsolar.com/directory/component), but there's no way I can go through these thousands of listings and evaluate each company to find the best investment opportunity.

What preferably non-Chinese, profitable and established manufacturer of solar panel- or related components, or supplier of the necessary base materials would you invest in?

We are now with Vanguard, and my spouse’s old account was held by a FA with a variety of funds with some high expense ratios, some over 1%.  I don’t think it makes sense for us to have two different positions in small cap funds with similar returns, especially if there is a 0.5% (or more) difference in expense ratios.   Does it make sense to go through and consolidate the similar funds, knowing we will incur a tax liability on the sale.  We are about 10-15 years from retirement, so 0.5-0.8% differences in expense ratios will add up. Given that the market is high right now, I’m ok selling some and just holding cash.

Is an etf limited in what securities it can purchase?

Is it limited to purchasing shares? I’m wondering if they could specifically hold options contracts. Is there a certain amount of time they need to hold their position? hypothetically could an etf, let’s just say arkk for example, go out and by options expiring in a month?

Seems like it could be a viable strategy for some to kind of act like a hedge fund. I remember hearing ark had Bitcoin at one point?

Ether, the token of the Ethereum network is a yielding asset. We can calculate an intrinsic value for the ETH token using traditional finance valuation models. 

You can find these in the following [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_r4DVzqWgoP7k0y-YXVdyKfEtpTaY-F6f5s9lc7sBNE/edit?usp=sharing). This spreadsheet is read-only and won't be edited to meet the rules of /r/investing, is provided as is.

Hope you enjoy the analysis and motivates an interesting discussion.

**Introduction**

The cryptocurrency asset space is largely misunderstood by the market resulting in significant inefficiencies in its valuation. From wild speculative valuations in tokens with no specific purpose, to some very significant undervaluations in others. I think the best way to help the market find the fair value of each asset is by building valuation models that root the value of the token in its fundamentals. The expectation is that armed with better models, market inefficiencies will diminish with time.

**Intended Readership**

This post can be beneficial to those well-versed in traditional finance and fundamental valuation models that do not understand what cryptocurrencies are and see them as shiny magical tokens with no intrinsic value.

On the opposite end of the spectrum it can be beneficial to those well-versed in cryptocurrencies; what they are, their use and purpose and understand their utility. But are not necessarily familiar with financial valuation models.

The large decoupling between these groups of people is probably cause of the severe mispricings occurring in the space. Hopefully this post and the valuation models provided can help bridge the gap between the two.

**Understanding Ethereum**

Ethereum is a settlement layer capable of executing smart contracts (small programs), in this regard you could consider it as not too dissimilar in functionality to a payment processor (e.g., Visa, Mastercard, Square...) that is also able to host and execute applications, like a Decentralized App Store. This settlement layer is highly decentralized and secure because it relies on thousands of independent nodes validating all the transactions executed on the network; there is no downtime, the network is censorship resistant, and is not owned by any individual or organization. This is the value proposition of the network, not every use case benefits from these properties but for those that do Ethereum is the leading platform.

**Ethereum Monetary Policy**

To pay for the security and decentralization the network pays its validators, remunerating them for their work. Additionally, this remuneration serves as an incentive for anyone to join the validation effort, increasing the security and decentralization of the network. This remuneration has 2 sources; newly minted tokens and transaction fees paid by the users of the network. I´m going to provide analogies rooted in traditional finance to help illustrate the parallelisms.

- Newly minted tokens are not too dissimilar to the issuance of new stock. When a company emits new stock existing shareholders dilute themselves (they have a smaller share of the company) and the newly created shares are given as remuneration to a subset of them, for example to employees as part of a stock based compensation program. It´s important to understand that creation of new tokens does not create value out of thin air, as it´s self-diluting. Instead, there is a transfer of value from all token-holders to the validators that receive those newly minted tokens.

- Transaction fees paid by the users of the network can be compared in this analogy to the revenues. When a user wants to settle a transaction on the network it pays for its use. The more transactions and the more valuable the fees of those transactions the more revenue collected by the network. A traditional finance person should immediately understand that if there are cash flows entering the system you can use those to create a valuation model. The throughput of the network is an scarce resource so the price paid for transactions is subject to demand and supply dynamics.

The revenue of the network (i.e. the transactions fees) is used in one part (around 20%) to remunerate the validators and the rest (around 80%) to reduce the token supply. These percentages are not fixed by the protocol but are instead a result of demand for the available transaction throughput, the values here quoted are the currently observed proportion. The token supply reduction operates in a way not too dissimilar to a stock buyback program, where income of a company is used to reduce the circulating supply of shares. This token supply reduction is commonly  nicknamed ""burning"".

**Monetary Model**

The network generates revenues. These revenues are used to pay validators for their work and reduce token supply. At the same time the network issues new tokens, that are used as another source of remuneration for the validators. The interplay between the token supply reduction through burning and the token issuance determines if the token supply is deflationary (net token destruction), inflationary (net token creation) or flat (no net change). Thus Ethereum's monetary policy is defined programmatically but is also adaptative to the market, if the price of Ether falls too low for its given revenues it will enter a strong deflationary regime to self-correct the situation. This gives Ethereum a very strong monetary policy (arguably stronger than Bitcoin) and consolidates the token as a store of value as it can be used to calculate a long-term lower bound price of the token. You can see this in detail in the Monetary Model tab.

**Yield Model**

With the introduction of a burn mechanism Ether became a yielding asset, the burn mechanism results in an effective yield for all token-holders in much the same way a buyback results in shareholder yield for shareholders. Ether becoming a yielding asset will be cemented even further with the transition to Proof of Stake (a.k.a. ""the merge""). With it, token-holders can become validators of the network and receive also the fee revenue (the other 20% of the network revenues). 

Yield opens up an entirely new price discovery mechanism. Without yield, the price of a token is purely based in supply and demand (this is the current situation for most cryptocurrencies). We may know the supply ahead of time, as it's defined algorithmically, but demand is fickle and changes on a whim. This results in a lot of volatility, particularly with low market capitalizations and small circulating supplies.

But yield gives us a comparable across asset classes. All else being equal, money tends to flow to higher yielding assets to extract that yield, in doing so the price of the underlying asset increases reducing the yield. This causes assets to converge relatively quickly to a yield comparable to the rest of asset-classes given certain measure of risk (e.g., volatility, total loss of capital, etc...) and expected growth. If the price of Ether becomes too low for a given value of the network fees, it will result in a very large yield and investors will flock to it to obtain the yield. This allows us to build a yield based valuation model. You can find said model in the Yield Model tab.

**DCF Model**

Discounted Cash Flow models are the gold standard of valuation. In a Discounted Cash Flow model the intrinsic value of an asset is computed taking into account the future cash flows it will generate and to which the stakeholder is entitled.

The idea is very simple, if an asset generates cash flows the value of the asset should be that of all the future cash flows it will generate. At the same time, receiving a large lump-sum very far in the future should be worth less than receiving it today as there is a time value of money. Money today can be invested and receive with it certain rate of return, so we should discount the future cash flows to take into account the time value of money.

We can do this with Ethereum and calculate its intrinsic value. DCF models are particularly sensitive to our assumption of the expected future cash flows and the discount rate so they will be more accurate the better you can forecast them. You can find this model and some base assumptions in the DCF Model tab.

**Why 3 models?**

In truth, there should only be one model, the one that correctly predicts the intrinsic value of the network. And this model is, in fact, the DCF model. The problem is that correctly forecasting the future cash flows and having a proper estimation of the discount rate is very difficult which makes DCF models quite prone to the garbage in/garbage out phenomenon, where poor assumptions lead to poor predictions of the model. Because of this we can benefit from 2 models that are very simple in comparison:

- The Monetary Model gives us a very good long-term lower bound of the token value. As the network will execute its monetary policy in a way that leads to this price acting as a lower bound long-term. Since the price set by the Monetary Model must hold true in the long-term we can use this price as the terminal value of the DCF.
- The Yield Model gives us a very good short-term view of the token value. As this yield can be obtained today, giving the market a powerful mechanism to quickly reflect the price that results in a yield comparable to the rest of asset classes (given certain measure of risk). If you set the discount rate to your expected yield you can view the Yield Model as the first-order expansion of the DCF model.

So the two models are simplified version of the DCF for two different regimes: long-term (Monetary Model) and short-term (Yield Model)."|investing|Fundamental Valuation Models of Ethereum|129.0|0.67

Wealthfront and Betterment at the time offered to do the conversion, and I went with Wealthfront.  I didn't want to put $6,000 in it, because I feared some tax mistake might be made.

I already have a federal work TSP account, which is now about $200,000.  This year I put in $15,010, so I figured with the $19,500 limit per year, I would put the rest into the Wealthfront Roth IRA.

I put in $3,522 into the Wealthfront Roth IRA account I made in 2020, a few days ago, and now I think I made a mistake.

I think I'm not allowed to add money to this Wealthfront Backdoor Roth IRA account, ever?

I am supposed to make a new Backdoor Roth IRA account, every year?

**Does that mean, if I did a backdoor Roth IRA for 10 years, I have 10 different Backdoor Roth IRA accounts?**

Which means, I should have opened a IRA, converted it to Roth IRA, pay taxes, with a new account each year?

I'm in my late 30s and was looking over my 401k today that I have with fidelity where I noticed I am 80 percent equities/index funds, 15 percent bond index fund (VBTIX) and 5 percent TIAA traditional (guaranteed).

Long story short, this portfolio is naturally underperforming all my others and the non equities are to blame.  Should a guy my age even bother with these or just rebalance to all index funds?

Should I take the 4K loss and use that as a write off for tax purposes? Will this gain push me into a new income bracket and I’ll have to pay 22% in taxes? Or, will the standard tax write off we get of $12,500 keep me in the income bracket that only is taxed 12% for short term gains for the year? My after tax take home income from work would be about 17k, and I have a realized gain in stocks for about 20k which would put me at around 37,000$ gain this year after taxes in total. Would it be best to sell my stock gain prior to the new year, or just keep holding it?

From what I read these are packaged into trances just like the mortgage backed securities, and have quite high ratings despite a number of factors. These factors include student loan forgiveness, and payment based on income which prolongs payment period, with both of these decreasing value of the bond. Im interested in knowing what a realistic rating on these would be considering the asset is not tangible like a house or a car, they have high ratings but to me they seem like bullshit.

This [article](https://frontierresearch.com/quantum-computing/?r=1) piqued my interest and I was wondering if this is a good time or if it’s still too early. So some backstory, 6 months ago I saw Honeywell International (HON) mentioned in relation to quantum computing. That got me looking more into the topic, as I had always thought QCs were decades away. But apparently, companies are already developing small quantum computers for commercial use (beginning of another Moore’s Law??).

I’ve browsed different stock-related subreddits but I don’t see this topic mentioned often. That also makes me wonder whether it’s still too early for QC-themed investments or whether people are just sleeping on it.

With 2022 approaching ever so quickly, I was wondering what your approach to the upcoming year is in terms of asset allocation. 

I must admit that 2021 ended with quite a few developments that I would not have expected at all. In spite of supply chain issues, rising inflation, the continuous disruption of economic processes by COVID variants and an approaching end of the Fed’s more than generous support of the US market, most of the large indices are trading at or near their all time highs, with no signs of a short-term slowdown (granted the volatility has been up as of late mostly thanks to Omicron).

I honestly never would have expected markets to keep the course this easily with all the above mentioned uncertainties/headwinds coming at them. With that being said, what are your macro level expectations for 2022 and how does it affect your overall asset allocation?

I for starters am sitting on a relatively big pile of cash waiting to be deployed once markets cool down. My underlying assumption is that we are going to see some sort of major correction in the near to mid future and I’d like to profit from that.

With that being said my current allocation looks something like this:

-37,5% in real estate (as investment, not personal)
-23,5% in a 2,8% yielding life insurance 
-19,5% in stocks
-18,5% in cash but intended to be in stocks eventually
-1% in other financial assets

So what are you guys’ thoughts going into 2022? Are you intending to modify your allocations once the fed raises the interest rates? And how are you currently allocating your assets? 

Looking forward to hearing about your approach to 2022! :)"|investing|Expectations and asset allocation for 2022|5.0|0.69

Currently have 25k emergency savings and 25k in the market (mostly blue chips). I’m thinking of purchasing 20k of I bonds with our emergency account and using that as my (and wife’s) emergency savings account. I assume they are similar to stocks where when you sell it takes several days to clear and funds transfer to your account. For that reason I would build the emergency fund up to 10k and sell stocks if an emergency came up in the first year before I could access the bonds. I don’t think I would keep more than whatever my emergency savings amount is in bonds because historically they earn less than VTO but am in favor because the ~3-7% return is much greater than a savings account.

However, Munster specifically highlighted high valuations for names like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN).

Munster quickly added that he believes in the long-term value of Big Tech but that earnings and revenue growth in 2022 will not be enough for most companies to overcome the contracting valuations that traditionally come with rising interest rates.

Tom Lee: 

""“For next year, I think it’s going to be treacherous. I think it’s going to be a much tougher year than 2021, and one of the reasons is you have the midterm elections,” said Lee, in a telephone interview. “You’ve got the Fed raising rates and liftoff, and it looks like it’s going to happen before the middle of the year, and you still have the lingering issues of the supply chain and inflation and Covid. “I think it’s easily flat or down in the first half.

&gt;China’s securities watchdog published a new draft regulation stating companies can list overseas as variable interest entities if they meet compliance rules

 

&gt;China’s securities watchdog has given tacit approval to a corporate structure that lets technology companies raise funds offshore, closing a two-decades-long regulatory loophole that has become a lightning rod in rising US-China tensions in capital markets.  
&gt;  
&gt;Chinese companies set up as variable interest entities (VIEs) are allowed to list in offshore markets if they register with regulators and meet compliance rules, according to a draft of a new regulation released on Christmas Eve by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC). The regulation also allows mainland-incorporated firms to directly list overseas without the need for a VIE if they meet the requirements. The draft was published online to solicit public opinion through January 23.  
&gt;  
&gt;The regulator said it would only assess the truthfulness, accuracy and completeness of submitted documents before giving applicants a green light for offshore listings, indicating that the registration-based system is not a stricter approval process.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The draft rule contradicts a [December 1 report from Bloomberg](https://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/3158198/chinese-securities-regulator-discussions-over-vies-hong?module=inline&amp;pgtype=article) that said China planned to ban initial public offerings on foreign exchanges through VIEs to address concerns about data security. It added that fundraising through VIEs would still be allowed in Hong Kong. 

 

&gt;The CSRC said that the rule is not retroactive, so companies already listed as VIEs overseas are exempt from the stricter rules. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Under the new rule, Beijing will strengthen oversight of companies’ operations, including the handling of data, before allowing them to list overseas."|investing|"""China’s new VIE rule eases concerns about overseas IPOs"""|64.0|0.83

Our planning has mainly been centered around getting this after-tax money into Roth accounts so we can unlock the power of untaxed growth. This makes the most sense as my current marginal rate is the lowest it will be in my career, and we assume taxes will rise in the future. We already add $6k to my Roth IRA annually.

My new company offers a Roth 401k which at face value seems like an attractive way to more quickly convert more of these funds to tax-free growth.

Does this plan make sense?

* Open a Roth 401k with my new company
* Max it out with the new limit of $20,500 this year  

   * This will require me withholding about 40% of salary, which I have verified my new company allows.
* Each month, parent deposits the difference between the 40% contribution and the 5% I was already contributing to get the company match. This ensures my take-home pay remains consistent.
* When I leave the job in the future, I can convert the Roth 401k to a Roth IRA.  

   * Essentially allowing me to convert 6k + 20.5k = 26.5k a year of taxable funds to a tax-free Roth IRA account.

Mix those and you have 4 different scenarios (inflation and rising economy, inflation and declining economy, etc).  He wants to have 25% in each of these, so that he will have 25% of his money in what's best for the current environment, 50% in a one step away allocation, and only 25% of his money in something targeted at the polar opposite environment.

Bogleheads suggest you pick 3 funds and continually rebalance between them.  Something like S&amp;P500, Some bond ETF, and some international fund.  Doesn't have to be an even split, but you should stick with the same split over time and keep rebalancing back to it.

If we pretended that Dalio was naming 1 fund for each of the 4 categories and putting 25% into each of them and constantly rebalancing, then what these two different groups are doing isn't that dissimilar.

So I was thinking to myself what would such a 3 fund portfolio look like if one was trying to orient it toward either (1) bull market, (2) sideways market, or (3) bear market?  Could one name a reasonable fund/etf for each of those cases and then rebalance between them and not do too bad for themselves over different market conditions.

I should point out (because I know someone else will if I don't) that Hedgefundie has attempted to do such a 2 fund portfolio, just without the sideways piece, only doing Bull and Bear.  I think his strategy has some meaningful flaws in it, but I don't really want to focus on that here.  Still, it's a reasonable attempt at what I am talking about.

Perhaps a 3 fund portfolio for up/sideways/down could be something like (Up) UPRO, (Sideways) QYLD, and (Down) TLT?

Somebody think of something better for the down portion.  Needs to be some kind of Talebesque thing that has a a basket of high yielding stuff and buying OTM puts for pennies in large quantities.  I am sure such a fund probably exists and I just don't know what it is.

Theoretically, one could just regularly rebalance  such a portfolio and get some decent alpha out of it.

Theoretically, it should also be a portfolio that somebody could somewhat safely apply leverage to.

Broker probably won't allow anybody to buy UPRO on margin, but at least one could probably get +25% leverage while leaving all the UPRO as secured by the cash and dipping into margin for what is missing on the other two.  If one just doubled up on the QYLD piece and left the other two at 25% allocations that is probably fine too.

  Facts: 

   47M. Make \~$200K in a secure field in a medium COL area of the US. I also have a military 'retirement"" that is currently paying out at about $38K per year and grows 2-3% per year to match with inflation. I consider this part of my retirement as it equals about 1/1.5 mil in payout in my retirement years. Im single, with no kids. I rent at the moment and own my car outright. Im living on about 45% of my monthly income.

   I currently max out my 401K and my Roth is maxed out in January every year. However, I only have maybe 200K in my 401K as it sits. 

  OK here's the question now:

I relocated jobs last March and sold my house as part of it. In the new location, I decided to rent due to the housing market and uncertainty with the area. So, over that time I collected a bit of a nest egg for when I decided to buy the following year (now ish). Since then though, it looks like Im not going to buy at all which leads me to sitting on $100K cash that I feel should be working for me somewhere. Having this cash available gives me anxiety and I tend to obsess over it not going below a certain threshold. I believe I want to put it in the market so that I can relax (like I do with my 401k/Roth investments).

   What would you do with it, in the current market? Put it in a few ETFs? Spread it across some individual stocks? Just keep in cash? Buy property somewhere else? Just spend it on toys for me? I really want to get to the point where I can feel comfortable spending money for me now that Im at a good career point. I struggle with that now.

Side note: I have a separate funded emergency fund and have nothing else tax advantaged that I can use.

Would you sell newly acquired shares if the **TOTAL** capital gains tax paid is less than what you would pay if you sold older shares that would be taxed as long term capital gains?

Example: you have 10 shares acquired over a year ago for $5/share and 10 shares acquired last month for $10/share.  The current price of the stock is $11, so selling either lot will get you $110 before taxes.

Long term capital gains on the older shares is $6, while short term capital gains on the newer shares is $1.

# Equity Portfolio Idea From Options

Hello beasts

Has anyone tried to make a long only equity portfolio in the past based on put call ratios and if so, how did it perform? I think it may be a good strategy but have not tried it.

In my personal vision, I would first find the 50 most liquid options chains. Then, I would calculate the put call ratio every week, and rebalance to the 25 with the lowest ratio every week. What do people think would happen and has anyone ever tried anything similar?

&amp;#x200B;

I had the idea to borrow money from Interactive Brokers at 1.5% interest and invest in closed end funds like PDI which is yielding 10%.  I would pocket the difference.  After taxes I estimate I would clear between 5-7% free profit. 

&amp;#x200B;

Risks would be if PDI cut the dividend which I deem fairly unlikely or my prinicpal going down in value.  This I estimate would be the biggest risk as it could force me to sell my PDI at an inopportune time if I got a margin call.  I would have to manage the position.  Another risk would be IB raising the interest rates on using their margin which I deem fairly likely in a rising interest rate environment.  Are there any other risks I'm missing?

Rentokill announced to buy Terminix.

From the Document:

&amp;#x200B;

Under the terms of the Agreement, Rentokil Initial will issue to Terminix shareholders at closing aggregate consideration comprised of approximately 643.29 million new Rentokil Initial shares (representing approximately 128.66 million American depository shares (“ADSs”), based on a 1:5 ADS to Rentokil Initial share ratio) and approximately US$1.3bn in cash. Based on Rentokil Initial’s 5-day average daily volume weighted share price and the 5-day average of the SterlingUS Dollar exchange rate both over the period spanning 6 to 10 December 2021 inclusive, this values the entire share capital of Terminix at US$6.7billion, **implying a value of US$55.00 per share of Terminix common stock**, and represents an aggregate consideration mix of 80% stock and 20% cash and(**Emphasis added**)

Currently TMX is trading for \~$45 with the deal expected to close in 2nd half of 2022 at the above $55.That means in \~6 to 12 months the stock should appreciate by 22%. or annualized 44% to 22% respectively.

Does this mean the market is assuming the deal will not close or is the market missing something? It seems too obvious?

Disclosure: Long TMX

**Edit estimated Deal Value**:

**For the ADRs**It says 128,660,000 shares of RentoKill ADRs which closed $39.49 = $5.08 billion+ cash of $1.3 billion = 6.380 billion / 121.1489 million TMX shares = **$52.67** per share

From Document: Under the terms of the Agreement, Rentokil Initial will issue to Terminix shareholders at closing aggregate consideration comprised of approximately 643.29 million new Rentokil Initial shares (representing approximately 128.66 million American depository shares (“ADSs”), based on a 1:5 ADS to Rentokil Initial share ratio) and approximately US$1.3bn in cash.

**or for the English shares**

584.80 in pounds \* 0.0132 USD/GBX = $7.73 price in USD of english shares5.3094 english shares to TMX shareholder \* $7.73 = $41.05

\+11.00 in cash for TMX shareholders = **$52.05**

From Document:The cash election consideration and the stock election consideration will be equalized to the value of the aggregate consideration per Terminix share, as measured by the value of 5.3094 new Rentokil Initial shares and $11 in cash as of the second day prior to closing.

**Either way, Im getting about $52 for something selling at 45.08. I don't get why there is an approximate upside of 15% just sitting there.**

Correction: not additional 100 TRY but the difference 200-120 = 80 TRY. Which makes the worst case scenario worse than just holding USD savings account.

When I was at the gas station last night, I looked to see if the pump and nozzle were made by Gilbarco. The pump said it was made by a company called Wayne (“a GE Energy Business”), and the nozzle said it was made by OPW (“a Dover Company”). 

Dover now owns both Wayne and OPW, I found out. And it also owns Tokheim, another gas pump manufacturer.

In the US, Vontier and Dover seem to have something close to a duopoly in this subsector—although there’s another company called Bennett Pump, which is privately held.

So if I bought some Dover stock, I would own pretty much everything there is to own when it comes to gas pumps and gas nozzles. (I had the impulse to do that, but I stopped myself.)

Of the dozen websites I have combed through I have not been able to find the answer to my question around realizing a loss on a larger quantity of shares than I purchased within the was sale window.  

I would like to do some tax loss harvesting prior to the end of the year but I want to make sure I fully understand this. I have a dividend paying stock that just reinvested the dividend to buy \~200 shares (say cost basis of $7) last week within the 30 day window I want to sell by EOY.  

I have a 1000 share lot at a cost basis of $9 and the stock is currently trading at $7.  

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to sell the 1000 share lot with a $9 cost basis for a loss.  Do I understand correctly that the wash sale would ONLY apply to 200 shares of those 1000 sold?  Or would it disallow the loss on the entire 1000 share lot?  

Here is the math:

($9 basis -$7 current share price) \* 1000 shares = $2000 unrealized loss today

Sell 1000 shares and realize losses on 800 shares \* $2 loss per share = $1600 realized loss allowed

200 shares \*$2 loss = Wash sale disallowed loss, add $2 cost basis to the 200 shares I recently purchased last week from the dividend.

The big Wall Street Banks, Large Individual Investors, and Hedge Funds know that statistically certain types of news stories are more likely to move the Stock Market as a whole and individual stocks up and down.  They use a variety of mathematical models based on events to predict how news stories will impact stock movements in the short run.  In some cases, they have the ability to buy or sell stocks the second the news is released or have access to the information well before the public. They also use historical models that show how certain types of incidents have impacted stock prices.

It can be accessed here: [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\_id=2900447](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2900447)

In the paper he concludes that from 1926-2016:

1. just 42.6% of common stocks have a buy-and-hold return (inclusive of reinvested dividends) that exceeds the return to holding one-month Treasury bills over the matched horizon.
2. More than half of common stocks deliver negative lifetime returns.
3. The single most frequent outcome observed for individual common stocks over their full lifetimes is a loss of 100%.
4. The 1,092 top- performing companies, slightly more than 4% of the total, account for all of the net wealth creation (returns in excess of one-month t-bills).

Most notable statement from the paper:

""just five firms (Exxon Mobile, Apple, Microsoft, General Electric, and International Business Machines) account for 10% of the total wealth creation.

 In my opinion, the Friday sell-off was because England raised their interest rates which makes NO logical sense when their country is a hotspot for the new variant. The rest of Europe didn’t and won’t raise interest rates in 2022 because of the variant. 

The CDC states this is going to get terrible in the U.S and the media says it’s mild when it’s not.

I have also invested in cyclical companies such as commodities and the retail sector. Reading books such as ""Benjamin Graham's Net Net Stock Guide"" by Evan Blaker, Joel Greenblatt, Warren Buffett, Seth Klarman, Peter Lynch's books, and the books by Philip Fisher have helped me to focus on the qualitative side of investing as well as different value investing approaches which has helped me look for good quality value stocks. 

Recently, I have used the wheels options strategy by taking further advantage of mispriced stocks such as getting paid to buy cheaper stocks via cash-secured puts and selling them for a profit when I think they are overvalued via covered calls.

Being empirical and wanting to find the best-tried investing methods, as well as behavioral finance has recently led me to momentum trading. Particularly, I have read ""Dual Momentum"" by Gary Antonacci and ""Quantitative Momentum"" by Wesley Gray. 

I was wondering if anyone else uses momentum trading and what are some key insights regarding the best momentum strategies. Are there any excellent resources that explain it in depth? 

Some questions I have are:

What are some of the best momentum indicators as well as strategies? What are the best methods of momentum trading? How long should you hold and optimize your holding position which tends to be less using momentum trading. Is trend following and using the 52 week high the best means? Would you do better by combining fundamental analysis with momentum trading or would it be better to separate the two approaches?

Based on what I have read so far it seems that some things you can do are compare different assets and see which ones are appreciating more (absolute momentum) and or then see which stocks/cryptos/bonds/commodities, etc are appreciating more in price (relative momentum). It also seems that a 3 -4 month holding period seems to be optimal and that it is better to buy or trade (reallocate) within the end of Feb, May, Aug, Nov for ""smart rebalancing.""

Firstly, I apologise if this is not the place to be posting this question. Feel free to point me to a better fitting sub if you can think of any

So, I've been working at a mature start up for about a year now. I joined as part of a growth cycle in which about 100 people were hired. My role is compensated well, mostly because I work in tech in a role with a lot of responsibility. I asked when I joined if I could have shares, they said it was in the works and coming to everyone soon. I didn't press too much as I was already receiving a big bump in salary.

Recently all existing employees have been offered Growth shares. The company have made a big deal about not wanting it to be about % stake in the business, or deciding based on salary. Which, if I'm being cynical, seems like that only stands to benefit them by making it harder to understand what you're getting.

Does anyone have experience receiving growth shares? Typically how many shares would you expect for a company at this stage? The only figure I've been told is based on the company's previous funding round, they were valued at ~$30m, if the company sold for $1B I would be looking at ~$90k return on the sold shares. Am I being unreasonable to think this isn't actually a very meaningful stake given how few startups actually reach that size?

Purely on numbers, I've worked the offer to be ~3.5% of my salary as Growth shares, vested over a 5 year period. Equating to ~0.0008% stakeholder in the business. 

Sorry for the ramble, Im planning to speak to them about it, but ideally I'd like a number in my head and some evidence of what other companies at this stage have offered in the past."|investing|I was recently offered shares by my employer|108.0|0.89

There is thought behind this. This will be in a non-tax account. With around 300 shares of TQQQ.

My goal for Fiscal Year 2022. My aspirations are simple - get a juicy return for 2022. My thesis is that tech will continue it's dominance, especially the mega techs. Google &amp; Microsoft should continue crushing it. Apple &amp; FB (sorry...META), not so much, but not so bad either. Others like Tesla, I expect to take a bigger jump up and make up more of the QQQ index in 2022.

I have around 300 shares of TQQQ. Enough for a simple covered call strategy on 3 lots. I plan on selling weekly covered calls on Monday morning. Will be looking for delta around 0.1-0.15. This should give around $1/lot/week = $300/week in premiums. If they get called away, great. This probably means the QQQ has run up a lot in a short period of time and I'm happy to wait for a dip back below by average selling price, to buy back the 300 shares.

If there is a prolonged crash in tech - still not so bad. I should still be able to get the weekly premiums consistently (though they may not be as high). I will continue gathering these premiums. They will not be put back into TQQQ. They will only go into TQQQ if/when I'm able to collect enough premiums to buy a full new lot. Otherwise, I'm happy to hang onto the premiums.

However, the markets rallied on the news of the taper from the FED.

From a valuations (economic benefits vs Risk) assessment, it makes sense that the markets would rally:

\- Interest rates remained the same.  
\- A day or two before the announcement the bond yield decreased therefore decreasing cost of debt.  
\- There was \*a little\* uncertainty surrounding MAYBE the Fed might touch interest rates a little bit. IF they HAD then cost of equity would have went up. But it was unlikely. Anyway the uncertainty surrounding this, made for an increased cost of equity in the days up until the meeting - so small sell offs/corrections occurred.  


BUT they never touched interest rates in the end!  
So Weighted average cost of capital would have decreased because the bond markets priced in the more aggressive tapers decreasing cost of debt and then cost of equity became less because the uncertainty around changing interest rates disappeared.

Any valuation method:  
\- PV of FCF - shows an increased MV  
\- Dividend discount models same thing.  
\- Multiples are going to get higher because decreased cost of capital.

Bear with me on the formatting, as I can't copy/paste tables that easily. This first part is an overview of Debt and Assets. TEVA purchased Actavis Generics off Allergan in 2015, which is the main origin of the debt. The generics business is volume-driven with not a lot of profit margin, so these purchases are not uncommon. It's a lot of cash, though, and one of the main pain points for the company right now.

The debt hinders growth/investment in biosimilars and resulted in rating downgrading \[Fitch BB, Moody’s Ba2 as of 31Dec20\]. It's the main focus of the current restructuring.

This table shows the relative high Cost of Sales relative to Net Revenue. I added some known expenses to get to the last column showing income after everything before. You can note the decrease in net revenue, which is mainly driven by generics price erosion from competition, consolidation of customers (85%) to achieve a greater bargaining power, and generics competition for a specialty blockbuster drug, Copaxone.

The last pain point is lawsuits, especially opioid and price-fixing. There is little data to be found on the merits of these lawsuits, but it's definitely spooking investors. What is clear are the costs of legal fees and goodwill impairments.

So it's not a pretty sight, and this all contributes to the low market capitalization.

The company has already begun restructuring, is aggressively reducing debt to the tune of 1-2 Billion USD a year, and is led by capable individuals. There are two specialty drugs (AJOVY and AUSTEDO) that are showing increased sales, although the pandemic is not helping in this regard.

Considering that the company is not paying dividends and has considerable risks, this is nothing for the risk averse or investors looking for quick bucks. However, the company valuation is down to the bare bones and there is good potential for long term investment. My decision to jump in is based on the restructuring underway, good leadership, and the risk constellation. The risk averse will like its long-term prospects but why away due to lawsuits exposure, the short-termists will see no point in investing now. I decided to park my gains from other stock here because I'm not risk averse and can afford to play the long game.

&gt;ISTANBUL, Dec 16 (Reuters) - The Turkish lira dropped to an all-time lowbeyond 15 against the dollar on Thursday ahead of another expected interest rate cutby the central bank, which has fallen in line with President Tayyip Erdogan's risky new economic programme.
&gt;
The lira touched 15.2 at 0606 GMT, a record low, and it has shed more than 50% of its value so far this year.  The central bank is expected to cut its policy rate by 100 basis points to 14% at its policy-setting meeting later in the day, a Reuters poll showed despite inflation soaring above 21%.

It's not a 100% solely because it's not an option for my 401K.  This strategy has done me well, and I believe it remains a reasonable risk.  

Why Microsoft?  Are they a good ethical company?  Heck no!  They don't care about you or me.  They hold two monopolies and they're not shy about abusing them.  They hold monopoly on the consumer OS, and they have no qualms shoving it down your throat.  Don't want Windows 10?  Disabled Windows 10 update?  Too bad, you're getting Windows 10.  I've heard a few stories, such as someone teaching a class but couldn't because MS decided to install Windows 10 at that time.  Windows 11 coming soon to a pc near you.

They also have a near monopoly on office productivity apps, but I am seeing Google making some headway.

Microsoft is worldwide.  Not dependent on one economy.  The have customers in government, commercial and consumer.  They have hardware (e.g. surface pc, xbox, etc.), games, and software for all these market segments.  In my opinion they are as diverse as you can get.  Plus, no management fees to hold stock directly (versus ETF/Mutual funds).

Let's look at other top tech brands.

Apple:  Apple gets a premium for their brand.  While they leverage this for a very nice profit margin, this is a single point of failure.  They have to maintain that brand, and it's rare for a company to maintain this over decades.  They could handle 1-2 hits every couple of years (e.g. child labor), but it's still a single point of failure.

Facebook:  They need our privacy rights to be almost non-existent.  As soon as privacy starts getting enforced, a whole huge chunk of their revenue goes away.  They recently took a hit with Apple's privacy changes.  Not sure what would happen if another Cambridge Analytica incident occurs.

Tesla:  It's simply way overpriced stock.  I respect Elon for taking a huge risk with EVs when no one was taking this market seriously, but Tesla's quality is poor, it's super expensive to repair, and they screw over used buyers by making them pay for features that the original buyer already paid for.  I wish the company does well, but even if it does, there are manufacturers who know how to scale production, which I think Tesla still has yet to learn.  As soon as more EVs come online, I think Tesla will struggle to compete.

The above companies make up a significant portion of tech ETFs, which is why I don't want to buy them.

I bought into AMC because of two reasons:

1. I believe (and still do) that movie theaters will continue to recover in attendance over time as we normalize into whatever COVID is going to normalize into. The recent dip in the stock tells me it’s not baked into the price anymore at least. Still, I am optimistic about movie magic combined with the antsy-ness of a population stuck at home for further gains on attendance. Here’s a quick graph showing why I believe this so strongly: [https://www.the-numbers.com/market/](https://www.the-numbers.com/market/). Even if it never recovers to pre-pandemic levels, which I feel it will, there's still plenty of growth left.
2. I really loved the A-List program. Many people I know have started to adopt it, observed over the last several years. When I had free time, I’d go see multiple movies per month and felt it was a great deal. Now that I don’t, I still keep the sub around because I feel that I might. Classic subscription benefit for the company. Also being able to book for my friends without having to do the Venmo runaround is great, esp for sell out MCU premieres.
3. I see AMC as a medium term play. Is it a sustainable business over the long term and will movie going see long term growth over the next 5-10 years? Maybe, but I'm not willing to bet on that. I am willing to bet that there will be a stock bump from an attendance resurgence as we recover from COVID, so something more like a bet of 1-3 years.

But I've also seen that in those cases, DCA underperforms by 3-5%, which seems to indicate that the losses are relatively small if you miss out on market gains by DCA (obviously market trend and the time you take to DCA matters here).


On the other hand, I'm curious to know what the downside of LS is in those 33% of cases where DCA wins? Normally, this isn't very relevant, because the chance of a major market drop within 12 months after you enter your lump sum is probably negligible and/or unpredictable. But considering ATH markets, I wonder if there is additional risk of a larger drop.


Normally, I would LS without thinking, but I'm not sure if the odds of a drop are higher in the context of sustained ATH markets. If the risk of DCA over 12 months is losing ~5%, but the risk of LS (in context of all time highs) is more significant, it may make sense to DCA. Is this just psychology?

I'll give my expectations here first

I think that inflation will remain fairly high through 2022 but it won't be at the levels that it is now, maybe around 3-4%, which puts most bonds at negative real rates right now, forcing investors if they want a real return to go into the equity markets and/or chase high yield bonds.

When the federal reserve starts hiking interest rates I personally don't expect that they will raise them at a very fast pace however if inflation doesn't start taming down they might. When rates rise the risk-free rate rises and its effect on equities is usually bad. As the discount rate rising the price that investors are willing to purchase a security will decrease or at least for institutional investors won't which of course make up most of the market. I think that may not be the case next year however because if investors still need to go into the equity market to chase real returns, the equities should still rise. I'm worried that equities are already in a slight bubble and that another year of these returns could show a market correction back down. If I was a betting man I would assume that within the next 1-3 years there will be a negative return in the S&amp;P500 which has only happened once in the last 12 years.

Investors still can't enter into the bond market without giving up a return. Sure an investor can buy futures contracts on treasuries because they expect an upward shift in the yield curve, which I expect to happen, to get a higher yield and decrease their interest rate risk. However, if you cannot accurately predict when the fed is done raising rates then that won't help you as when you are obligated to buy those treasuries you will have interest rate risk issues. Buying short-term bonds to help with duration would help that problem but those also will more than likely result in a negative real return anyways if inflation doesn't cool off and the equity should've been the move anyways.

I would say that the Financial Services sector will benefit from the rising yields especially as corps and people demand large purchases as demand is hot.

I would also say that Industrials and Cyclicals will outperform as demand will drive the Cyclicals and the Industrials from infrastructure and servicing the demand in Cyclicals.

I think that elevated Materials prices will fall, hurting that sector.

Staples could be a hedge against a downturn in the market which I expect in the coming years.

Technology and communication services may have a bumpy road ahead with rising rates because the discount rate increasing hurts them the worst. Comm services wouldn't be as greatly affected but because of high tech companies in the space. More value may be the direction to take.

I'm always bullish on healthcare as innovations and rising populations will always benefit that sector. I may change my focus away from Biotech and into more stable earning healthcare companies.

Summary: 

A wave of programs intended to boost loans from European banks has has left Euro banks flush with cash and little opportunity for investment. The situation has driven the same banking institutions to look over seas for places to park cash.

The process has caused a significant demand for USD as European banks move Euros to Dollars  to earn 0.05% in deposits with the Fed. even with a strengthening dollar and paying a premium for euro cross-currency basis swaps, the opportunity continues to look attractive to European banks whom were able to borrow from the ECB at -1.0%.

Analysts expect this trend to diminish after the first of the year once banks year end balance sheets are set and in anticipation of additional treasury supply following the Feds tapering &amp; increased debt ceiling.

The relative recent strength of the USD and the potential for slowdowns in Dollar demand from Europe could provide an opportunity to rebalance existing US Equity/Int'l Equity positions that have become out of sync due to dollar strength and the relative equity performance over the past year."|investing|Cash Glut in Eurozone Drives Dollar Demand|356.0|0.91

My property taxes and insurance totals $535 a month for my escrow to have a tiny surplus at the end of the year. My home owners insurance just informed me they're increasing the premium by about $150 a year. 

**El Plan**: I'm going to purchase $550 in QQQ on the first of every month ($550*12=$6600) from 2/1/2022 to 1/30/2023 (property taxes due in TX.)

I looked at a ETF QQQ calculator. Every year, for the past 10 years, it would win, with varying profits of $200 for a particular year to $1700 for a particular year. Two years, it lost. Biggest loss $500 for that year. 

I also did the math and found it would be slightly more profitable (1-2%) if I made my purchases weekly of $127($127*52=$6600 of QQQ.)

**Where I could be wrong**: I am starting to think about the taxes side of it. Will I get smoked because this money will only be in an account 11 months at a time before starting again after the taxes and insurance is paid? I don't think the IRS is going to eat away at my plan when it's all done each year. ($-500 to $1700)

Also, i am likely going to just grow the account in anticipation for rising property taxes and home values (Insurance seems to go up when value of home rises - go figure.)

**Am I crazy?** I searched and couldn't find much info about doing this. I've seen people do ""high-yield"" accounts, but nothing about purchasing stocks weekly/monthly instead. Bet your ass that the banks and lenders are using the money we put in for escrow to invest anyway.

I came across this thread on Reddit about Roblox and various practices they employ, whilst there was a lot of concerning things, I have some questions about the in game items and marketplace offered by Roblox.

One of the comments I saw was about Roblox's valuation on the stock market and that got me thinking about what I consider a securities market within Roblox itself.

I would like to hear your thoughts on this and whether or not you'd think these items to be considered securities. I may have gotten certain things horribly wrong with regards to US law, assumptions made etc, so feel free to call me an idiot if so, but please point out your counterarguments! My post mainly focuses on Roblox, but realistically it could be applied to any game that allows in game items to be resold.

https://np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/rfgazz/roblox_pressured_us_to_delete_our_video_so_we_dug/

*****

I know they're only in game items, but I think they could be classified as securities because they can be bought and sold (indirectly) with real money (via robux).

Now of course I am not a lawyer, and have no clue how any of this works (and how it probably also doesn't apply to many other companies that sell, resellable in-game items)

##The Howey Test

&gt; The Howey Test refers to the U.S. Supreme Court case for determining whether a transaction qualifies as an ""investment contract,"" and therefore would be considered a security and subject to disclosure and registration requirements under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Under the Howey Test, an investment contract exists if there is an ""investment of money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the efforts of others.""

- https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/howey-test.asp

###Investment of money

&gt; “The first component of the Howey test focuses on the investment of money. The determining factor is whether an investor chose to give up a specific consideration in return for a separable financial interest with the characteristics of a security""

- *Securities &amp; Exchange Commission v. SG Ltd.*, 265 F.3d 42 (1st Cir. 2001)

When Roblox releases an item for sale, I believe that it could constitute an investment of money, as the purchaser gives up their Robux (specific consideration) in return for an in-game item (separable financial interest with the characteristics of a security). In this case, I would argue that a contract is formed by two interested parties: Robux and the purchaser of the asset with regards to ownership of the asset.

**But wait, it's Robux, not money?**

&gt; ""it is well established that cash is not the only form of contribution or investment that will create an investment contract. Instead, the ""investment"" may take the form of ""goods and services,"" Daniel, 439 U.S. at 560 n. 12, 99 S.Ct. at 797 n. 12, or some other ""exchange of value.""""

- *Uselton v. Commercial Lovelace Motor Freight*, 940 F.2d 564 (10th Cir. 1991)

Basically here I am arguing it doesn't have to be cash that is being used to form the contract, and yes, Robux does fulfill this requirement. (And bear in mind Robux can be bought and sold for USD and various other currencies).

###Common enterprise

&gt; A common enterprise is a venture ""in which the `fortunes of the investor are interwoven with and dependent upon the efforts and success of those seeking the investment. . . .'"" It is not necessary that the funds of investors are pooled; what must be shown is that the fortunes of the investors are linked with those of the promoters, thereby establishing the requisite element of vertical commonality. Thus, a common enterprise exists if a direct correlation has been established between success or failure of [the promoter's] efforts and success or failure of the investment.

- *Securities &amp; Exchange Commission v. Eurobond Exchange, Ltd.*, 13 F.3d 1334 (9th Cir. 1994)

I would argue that a common enterprise is established by the fact that the value of the asset purchased by the investor is dependent on Roblox's efforts in advertising a known asset on its marketplace, managing the marketing and scarcity of the asset, as well as it's initial offering price etc.

Furthermore, after Roblox issue the assets, they still oversee the exchange of these assets. If the investor is successful and decides to sell at a higher cost (whether to Roblox or an unaffiliated party), there is a direct correlation between the investor's success and Roblox's success as Roblox take a 30% cut of the sale. If the value was lower, Roblox would still take a 30% cut but won't be as successful if the sale was higher (in some cases significantly higher than the original price).

### Expectation of profit to be derived from the efforts of others

An investor may purchase an in-game asset from Roblox under the impression that it is a limited offering and may presume that the value of the known asset will increase such that Roblox limits the sale of these assets to a fixed amount. Moreover, the investor assumes risk directly coming from the promoter, for example in the event that Roblox issues more of the same assets; this would increase the supply of the asset and potentially reduce its perceived value.

###Are Roblox in-game items securities then?

I don't know, like I said, I'm not a lawyer. I know other games also have similar models but I've never heard them be critiqued as securities. Loot boxes have had some contention about being gambling, but I think it might be time to start looking at virtual assets as securities. Though a lot of games do not let you resell the items (e.g. Fortnite), or if they do then it's only for an in game currency that cannot be converted back to a fiat currency (e.g. EA FIFA).

Roblox allow users to:

- buy Robux for fiat currency (e.g. 100,000 Robux for 1250 USD)
- invest in assets with that Robux,
- sell assets for Robux (whilst Roblox takes a 30% cut) at a profit or loss (but Roblox's fortunes from the sale are directly correlated with the investors fortunes from the sale),
- sell that Robux for fiat currency (100,000 Robux for 350 USD - a 72% exchange fee!)

In my totally not legal opinion, Roblox is effectively running an unregulated currency exchange when it comes to the selling of Robux (via Tipalti), an unregulated securities market when it comes to the buying and selling of in-game assets (which may be issued/sold by Roblox, but they benefit regardless due to a 30% commission - and they benefit more if they can create demand and scarcity for items they issue), and have created scenarios where there users are unwittingly becoming investors of securities aided by price history charts, information about limited availability, generating and marketing hype around assets etc.

In my opinion these assets are more similar to securities than they are to commodities.

Anyway, I was looking to start a discussion regarding this, I could be very wrong and I accept that; especially as this model has been used for a long time I believe (especially amongst MMO games?). I would love to hear any counterarguments etc, or other related talking points

*****

Flaw 1: You never own the asset itself, the assets always belong to the developer studios / companies themselves and are licensed to Roblox to be able to be used on the platform, though no ownership changes hands

Thanks to /u/McPutio for pointing this out

Flaw 2: You cannot sell Robux for real USD made in this way (though there probably are workarounds that Roblox do not approve of)

Thanks to /u/hiImKhi for pointing this out! It's a part of their DevEx platforms rules that the Robux must be ""earned"".

This means their clause in the ToS about Robux not being redeemable for cash makes a lot more sense now, as developers can't cash out any Robux other than that made by selling items that they have created"|investing|"[Discussion] Are in-game virtual items that can be sold for ""real money"" considered securities under US Law?

I manage most of my assets personally and, as a result, I feel an ongoing responsibility to understand the world around me, as this enables me to make the best investment decisions I can.

Recently, I’ve been thinking about how to best allocate my portfolio given the current state of asset valuations, government debt, and general investor sentiment.

Through studying the works of Ken Galbraith, Howard Marks, Ray Dalio and other great investors, I have learned that the single most important variable in determining whether I should be aggressive or defensive with my portfolio strategy is the debt cycle. The ability to understand where we are in the debt cycle, and adjust our portfolios accordingly, is one of the hallmarks of great investors.

I have decided to share my thoughts here in order to get your feedback.

Before diving in, I want to emphasize that these are my views, and that different people have different perspectives. I hope that by sharing my views, I will encourage debate and advance our understanding together.

***TLDR:*** *The debt &amp; credit cycle are paramount in helping me understand how to think about my portfolio strategy.*

# Cycles

At its core investing is making good decisions about the future. To do this well, investors need to form probability distributions of different outcomes to guide their actions.

But it is important to remember that even if we know the probabilities, we don’t necessarily know the outcome.

Howard Marks has a helpful analogy: successful investing is like choosing a lottery winner. The winner is determined by one ticket (outcome) being pulled from a bowl of tickets (many possible outcomes).

Superior investors have a better sense of what tickets are in the bowl, and thus, whether it is worth participating in the lottery. Said another way, great investors don’t know exactly what the future holds, but they have an above-average understanding of future tendencies and probabilities.

This brings us to cycles.

Understanding cycles helps us form a view of future probabilities. It helps us understand how many winning lottery tickets there are in the bowl.

Analyzing cycles is not a precise science. The goal is not to time the market; rather, it provides a directional sense of what has happened, and what might happen. Marks explains this elegantly:

*The superior investor is attentive to cycles. He takes note of whether past patterns seem to be repeating, gains a sense for where we stand in the various cycles that matter, and knows those things have implications for his actions. This allows him to make helpful judgments about cycles and where we stand in them. Specifically: Are we close to the beginning of an upswing, or in the late stages? If a particular cycle has been rising for a while, has it gone so far that we’re now in dangerous territory? Is the market overheated (and overpriced), or is it frigid (and thus cheap) because of what’s been going on cyclically?*

The most important cycle for investors to follow is the debt cycle.

# Credit &amp; Debt

Since we will use the terms “credit” and “debt” a lot, I will quickly define them.

Credit is the giving of buying power. When you take on credit, you exchange it for a promise to give it back; this is called debt.

Credit and debt, in and of themselves, are good things, and little credit and debt can be a bad thing. For example, if there is credit available to build roads, schools, and other essential infrastructure, that is a good thing. If the credit and debt are used to consume goods outside of one’s income level, that is a bad thing.

So, the overarching principle is that credit is desirable when the borrowed money is used productively to generate enough income to repay future debt obligations. If this occurs, good decisions have been made, and both the lender and borrower will benefit.

# Debt Cycles

At the highest level, a debt cycle is the oscillation between credit and debt being easily available and being scarce. \[1\]

When credit is easily available, there is more money in the system. This leads to growth in GDP, asset prices, incomes, etc. and is called an economic expansion, or a “boom.” To prevent prices from growing indefinitely, central banks taper credit, which causes everything to shrink. This is called an economic contraction, or a “bust.” This dynamic has existed for as long as credit has been around, predating the Roman Empire. \[2\]

Debt cycles are nothing more than a logically driven series of events that recur in patterns. Whenever you borrow money, a debt cycle is created.

Let’s explore this in more detail.

A debt cycle has two distinct phases: (1) expansion; and (2) deflation.

**Expansion:**

Every debt cycle begins with widely available credit.

There is a famous line in In Fields of Dreams, “If you build it, they will come”. In the economy, if you offer cheap debt, people will borrow.

When debt is cheap, the threshold for its productive use is lower and skews more toward consumption. Since one person’s spending is another person’s income, higher consumption leads to higher incomes. Eventually, this leads to higher asset prices (stocks, bonds, real estate, crypto-assets, etc.) since there is more money chasing assets.

This has a positive self-reinforcing effect.

As incomes and asset prices inflate, people feel rich and start to take on even more debt.

Creditors look at the increased net worth of their debtors and feel comfortable giving them more debt. \[3\] This strengthens the feedback loop. Risk averseness diminishes, investor sentiment shifts toward optimism, and everyone thinks the good times will last forever. At this point debt is used more recklessly to fund consumption or projects with negative returns.

**Deflation:**

Eventually, to stop the upward cycle central banks taper credit, by making it more expensive. Making debt more expensive has two impacts: (1) people are less likely to take on new debt; and (2) existing debt becomes more expensive, which increases the risk of default and shifts spending away from consumption and investment to debt repayment. This triggers a negative spiral.

A lack of credit creates a liquidity problem. Investors and lenders become more critical of who they lend to. There is less money flowing around and consumption is reduced. Reduced consumption reduces income (remember that one person’s spending is another’s income). Lower incomes and lower asset prices mean lower net worths. Lenders, who were providing credit based on higher income and asset prices feel exposed and tighten credit even more. This creates a self-reinforcing cycle and the downward spiral continues.

**Resetting the cycle:**

To combat the downward spiral, central banks lower interest rates and make credit easily available again.

This marks the end of one cycle and the beginning of the next.

# The Most Important Cycle

The slammed-shut phase of the credit cycle probably does more to make bargains available than any other single factor – Howard Marks

Why do I ascribe such importance to debt cycles?

Because credit, at least, impacts four important economic factors:

* Income Growth: Open credit markets are inflationary for wages. When credit is available, consumer spending is high. One person’s spending is another’s income, thus resulting in higher incomes and tighter labor markets.
* Net Worth / Asset Growth: Easily available credit results in more money chasing the same assets. This leads to higher asset prices and, as a result, higher net worths. Investors feel rich.
* Earnings / Company Growth: Companies need to fund investment in innovation and R&amp;D to grow. Credit makes up the largest part of the capital pool. Cheap credit allows numerous projects to be funded, resulting in higher growth.
* Default Rates: Credit must be available for maturing debt to be refinanced. Entities, like companies, governments and consumers, often don’t pay off debts. Most of the time they roll them over. But if a company is unable to secure more debt at the time that its existing debt comes due, it may      default and enter bankruptcy. \[4\]

When the credit markets are wide open, the cumulative effect of the above is overly optimistic investor sentiment. When incomes and net worths are high, growth rates attractive, and all businesses avoiding default, people think the music will never stop. As a result, the potential risk-reward spectrum of investing is at its least favorable.

But investor sentiment is also a cycle, shifting from overly euphoric to overly pessimistic. When we enter the deflationary stage of debt cycles, the inverse is true.

# Making Good Decisions

The ultimate purpose of this essay is to enable you, the reader, to have a sense of where we stand in the debt cycle and take the appropriate action.

As such, I have outlined some typical signs of an open and cautious credit market.

Signs of an open credit market:

* Fear of missing out on profitable opportunities
* Reduced risk aversion, due diligence and skepticism
* Too much money chasing too few deals
* High debt levels and reduced ability to service debt expense
* High asset prices, low potential returns, high actual risk, and low perceived risk

Signs of a cautious credit market:

* Fear of losing money
* Heightened risk aversion and skepticism
* Shortage of capital everywhere
* Economic contractions and difficulty refinancing debt
* Low asset prices, high potential returns, low actual risk and excessive risk premiums

What does all this mean?

It means that one of the best ways to enjoy superior returns is to get the market on your side. Outcomes will never be under your control, but if you invest when the lottery tickets are biased toward favorable, you will have the wind at your back. Understanding cycles gives you a better chance of knowing when this is and positioning your portfolio accordingly. It helps you understand how many winning tickets are in the bowl and whether you should buy one.

The next logical question is where are we currently in the debt cycle and how should my portfolio be skewed toward the balance between aggressive and defensive?

At the time of writing this, I am leaning toward neutral-to-defensive. \[5\] When uncertainty is high, asset prices should be low, creating high potential returns that are compensatory. However, the combination of money printing and low interest rates has forced asset prices to be the opposite. While I don’t think prices are egregiously high, it is hard to find mouthwatering deals.

*Notes, Inspirations &amp; Additional Readings*

\[1\] Ray Dalio explains that there are two debt cycles we should pay attention to: the short-term debt cycle and the long-term debt cycle. For the sake of this essay, I have ignored this distinction and the policy and political implications associated with them.

\[2\] In Debt: The first 5000 years David Graeber lays out the historical development of debt. The first recorded debt system was in the Sumer civilization around 3500 BC.

\[3\] What I find fascinating is that this seems rational. For example, if you buy a house for $50 in year 1 with $25 of debt your total debt-to-asset ratio would be 50%. The next year, your house is worth $75 on paper, so your debt-to-asset ratio is now 33%. Based on this, you take on more debt to get the ratio back to 50%, resulting in \~$38 of debt. But what if your home price drops back to $50? Then your debt-to-asset would be 76%.

The point here is that the amount of credit one has available is often based on asset value, which is a variable number.

\[4\] Many corporate assets, such as buildings and machinery, are long-term in nature. But they are often financed with short-term debt because the cost of borrowing is lower relative to long-term debt. This mismatch is what drives the default risk that is associated with credit markets drying up.

EvBox: Europe’s biggest EV charging-station company.

-190,000 EV charging ports delivered globally around the world up to the year 2020, the most of any company in Europe, with that number expected to be much higher now in 2021.

-$135 million in revenue for 2021.

-Their charging stations look [fabulous](https://i.imgur.com/6ungMKG.png)

-[Attractive valuation](https://i.imgur.com/l4cVmiK.png), much cheaper than its competitors, EvBox will be trading at only 6.7x 2021 EV/Revenue, and 3.6x their 2022 revenue. Compare this to Chargepoint that trades at 76.1x their 2021 revenue, and 43.6x their 2022 revenue. 

-A 72% YoY Growth from 2020 to 2021, from $79 million to $135 million in revenue. They have also announced in a statement that they expect revenue for next year to be $252 million, which is a 87% growth from this year. 

-EvBox quality of products [compared to its peers](https://i.imgur.com/6dw2z7K.png)

-EvBox partners with key companies from various industries around the world to provide charging infrastructure for cities, enterprises, and residents.

-Partners include: France’s ""Engie""($70 billion dollar company), France’s ""Rexel""($13 billion dollar company), Sweden’s ""Vattenfall""($18 billion dollar company), Netherlands ’Eneco’($4,6 billion dollar company), Denmark’s ’Norlys’(4,8 billion dollar company), Iceland’s ’On Power*, and many others companies around the world from different nations.

-Example of [customers](https://i.imgur.com/4cxHNxX.png) include: Ikea, Lidl, DHL, Pfizer, Mcdonalds etc. 

-Through partnerships, EvBox has managed to provide cities around the world with charging infrastructure, cities such as Amstardam, Rotterdam, Monaco, New York State and many others.

-[European Market Leader](https://i.imgur.com/0YuCHr5.png): There exists two types of charging methods for electric vehicles, they're called ""AC"" and ""DC"". EvBox has a 25% market share of all ""AC"" public charging in Europe, and a 35% market share of all ""DC"" charging in Europe, which is just incredible.  

-Award winning tech, awards include: 1st place in the CleanTech sector for Netherland's ""Deloitte Technology Fast 50"" in 2016. Named a Grid Edge Award winner by Greentech Media and highlighted as an industry leader focused on paving the way towards tomorrow's distributed energy systems in 2017. Named a CES Innovations Award Honoree in the category of Smart Energy with the Elvi product in 2018. Also featured on the Inc. 5000 Europe List of fastest-growing private companies in 2018. Named as a leading provider of Public Charging Network and EV Charging Services by Navigant Research in 2019. Won a CES Innovations Award, a iF Design Award, and a Red Dot Award. 

-EVBox is set to install [300,000 charging stations](https://www.electrive.com/2021/09/16/evbox-to-install-300000-charging-stations-across-denmark/) across Denmark by the year 2030. The contract is with Denmark’s largest energy and telecommunications company [Norlys](https://news.evbox.com/en-WW/201875-norlys-signs-multi-year-partnership-with-evbox-group-to-boost-electric-mobility-across-denmark), a company which had $4,8 billion in revenue for 2020. Installations have already started.

State of the spac: Negotiations have been ongoing for almost a year now and are still ongoing today, and I believe that a confirmation on whether the merger will happen or not should be due any minute now. If the negotiations fail, TPGY’s stock price would probably go back down to nav at $10 which is only a -2% loss considering the share price is $10,18 at the moment of writing this. However if the negotiations succeed and we get a merger, we could perhaps get a +200% or even +300% gain considering that previously a merger news-article made the share price go from $10 to $33 in only a couple of days earlier this year.

**TLDR;** $TPGY is negotiating for a merger with EvBox, Europe’s biggest EV charging infrastructure company, with $135 million dollars in revenue for 2021, over 190,000 charging stations in 2020, partnerships with many different multi billion dollar companies around the world from different nations including France, Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, Iceland etc. 300,000 charging stations set to be installed in Denmark by the year 2030, award winning technology, cheaper valuation compared to its peers, proven better quality of products compared to its peers, long list of famous brands as their customers, etc. You can lose -2% if negotiations fail and it goes back to NAV, however if the deal does go through it could explode, maybe to the levels of its previous shareprice of $33 which is a 330% gain. This is a great deal which is the reason I've chosen to invest.
